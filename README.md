# Understanding Customer Experiences through Sentiment Analysis

The project involved scraping online reviews of a music store from trust pilot and cleaning the data using Python.
This included tasks such as handling missing values and converting data into a suitable format for analysis.
Once the data was cleaned, it was used to perform analysis on the reviews,
including identifying common themes and trends in the feedback. In addition, sentiment analysis was
conducted on the reviews to determine the overall sentiment of the reviewers (positive, negative, or neutral).
The results of the analysis were used to understand customer experiences and identify areas for improvement in 
the stores. 
Overall, the project demonstrated the usefulness of using data science techniques to analyze customer reviews and gain insights into customer experiences.
