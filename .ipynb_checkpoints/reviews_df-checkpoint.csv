Violent staff member choked a customer because he was scared? Living in fear as customer didn‚Äôt have a mask. Store worker never offered a mask. Emergency services had to be contacted!

Might need to educate your staff"
7,1,2022-02-14T06:32:14.000Z,"Violent staff chokes customer, should be sacked.
Physically choking a customer because he wasn't wearing a mask, who also is exempt from wearing a mask as he told the salesperson who attacked and choked him, the police and ambulance were called and the customer is absolutly traumatised because of this incident, sacking that salesman might be a good move, store manager!"

Better Music are easy to deal with and got my recording equipment to me fast even during covid"
29,3,2022-02-04T01:11:59.000Z,"Please notify when delivered
The item was delivered and is as expected, thank you. Something that could be improved for your future orders is to provide text or email notifications, when the item is on its way, and especially once it has been delivered.. it helps to know as some items are quite expensive & we don't want them left out on the porch all day for fear of theft. We bought a keyboard and I have no idea how long it was sitting outside for, and it was in no other box exept the branded one so we were advertising to our neighbours what we have bought. I was home when it was delivered but heard no knock at the door & received no electronic notification. I was surprised to see it later that day when I went to leave the house.. disappointingly my daughter saw it too and it was supposed to be a surprise Xmas gift for her :( Little things like keeping the buyer aware of delivery times, especially before Christmas, would make for much happier customers. Otherwise we are very happy with our purchase, thank you."

Good people to have out there should your Thing be a bit of a mission to locate!
(The K&M guitar stand had to be red; only my guitars knew why!) A call from Kristin-- Plan B
seamlessly activated-- follow-up emails as we held our course through the dreaded Festive Season Vortex! All concluded more than well;
there was even Human Handwriting to be found inside the parcel! My guitars saw that finally I understood...
Thank you all at Better Music in the A.C.T.

Delivery was quick and the product itself is excellent quality.

But the product photo showed a red tuner, which is what I wanted. So i bought two, and when they arrived and opened the boxes, I saw they are both black. I need these tuners so I have kept them, and I think it would be too complicated to send them back after I opened them. But I am not happy that I was sent black instead of red, as the colour of my gear is part of my artistic presentation. I would appreciate the chance to either exchange them for red ones, or buy two red ones at a very reduced price. I will happily edit this review to a more positive one if this problem is solved."

I must admit I was worried my research could be off but happy to confirm that the case to suit Taylor Mini GS is 100% compatible with the Lanikai mini bass/bass uke.

You had the product I needed and it was shipped a day after ordering which was good, but I have a couple of issues with the website: 'Free shipping' turned out to be for eastern seaboard only, not WA. Interstate postage/freight in Australia is uniform or consistent enough that I question the necessity of excluding WA. Perhaps you should use AusPost instead, who's interstate parcel rates are uniform, so you can offer a better Australia-wide customer service. [Edited: removed comment about ex-
GST prices. My mistake.]"
313,4,2021-12-06T02:52:33.000Z,"Free shipping is not free shipping, but they refunded the issue without any hassle
Summary
'Free shipping' = confusing
Customer service = sorted things out quickly and well

If on customer service alone, I would give 5 stars, the shipping part 3 stars (its up to you read the confusing messages) so on average 4 stars

I made a purchase via website because of the 'free shipping'.
However it is not clear and only at the last payment page there is a 'minimum shipping fee' that overrides any 'free shipping' messages you have seen previously.
I actually didn't realise until i clicked 'purchase' that something didn't add up and I had to go back to find the minimum shipping cost
However when I sent email asking for this order to be cancelled and refunded, the service people did so promptly and without any stress"

A few hours after asking for my money back the item was listed on the website with a price increased by another $100.

I placed an order online for a product that was highlighted in 'Green/In-Stock' in mid-September. There was a 'Covid-19 Disclaimer'! Which read, ""Due to the current situation, your order may take 4-7 days to be shipped"". I thought was a fair estimate. After 14 days passed, I contacted them by phone, and was told, ""Our suppliers have informed us that this product is not in the country, expected date is mid-October"". H'mmm.... OK! I'll wait. A further 10 days passed, phoned again. The response was, ""Sorry, our suppliers 'missed'? our 'Purchase Order'!

I even called up during that time and was told that the staff member would call me back. I'm not sure why it seems that Better Music doesn't want my custom."

422,1,2021-09-06T03:39:11.000Z,"I really don't like giving bad reviews
I really don't like giving bad reviews, but there has been a comedy of errors in the processing of this order - some were out of the control of Better Music, others could have been handled differently.

The reason I went with Better Music is because I wanted to support a smaller business than JB HiFi and the like. Here are the errors, classified into unavoidable and avoidable:

Unavoidable:
-the website of the manufacturer who supplies Better Music encountered a cyberattack, delaying all the orders (I was under the impression Better Music already had this in stock);
-once the order was received by Better Music, they were asked to vacate their premises due to COVID restrictions and unable to action their orders;

Avoidable:
-the only correspondence to the above was due to personal enquiries regarding the order over a couple of weeks, and not on the part of Better Music;
-finally, the wrong suburb was used on the order, so the parcel has been sitting in StarTrack's depot for about a week now (I found this out after calling StarTrack twice).

Essentially, a gift for my wife's birthday that I ordered six weeks ago still has not arrived.

I empathise with Better Music to a certain extent, though I will need to go to the dark side (JB HiFi) next time I need an order in less than a month."

429,2,2021-08-19T12:51:13.000Z,"The reason why I gave two stars is not‚Ä¶
The reason why I gave two stars is not that the service is not good but their advertisement claiming they can do price match with other store competitors. I found that better music is not fully committed to what they claimed in their advertisement regarding price matching. I tried to do a price match 3x already but ended up buying to another store. It's just so sad that I'm a local in Canberra but have to purchase my PA stuff from Derringer's Music because they can't go after with the price. Bettermusic should adhere to what they claim; otherwise, it's a false advertisement."

Although during the lockdown, Morgan and her team managed to help me get my very first Kawai digital piano. However, it will be more great if the install staff could show up to set up the piano as I communicated over the phone. I totally understand it might be difficult to have someone come to door for this. But we actually didn‚Äôt expect to install by ourselves, luckily there was a clearly instruction manual to direct us and we have all the tools from our storage and inside the delivery box.

I am finding information on the violin a bit hard to come by in my web browser eg connecting to output takes all switches on full to get an amplified response.
I would like to know more about the active control system, I will keep googling.

the service was very helpful"
481,5,2021-08-12T03:34:22.000Z,"A+ Highly Recommended
Given the circumstances regarding the delivery of a boutique amp, and the fact that when the original order was placed, stock from the USA was destroyed in the boutique amps warehouse fire.. I have to give credit where credit is due. Kristen was transparent with her communication regarding the delay of delivery, however gave me confidence to not withdraw my ""paid in full"" commitment to Better Music and wait patiently for such a brilliant unique amp to arrive. Appriciate the support and absolutely dig the new amp.

Thankyou.

Two stars only because the tone knob on the guitar was clearly not checked before the guitar shipped. The tone knob is stiff and grinding when turned. A very obvious problem used out of the box. A sticker on the guitar indicates the manufacturer did a check. It might have been assumed by the seller that there was no need to do another check. It was properly packed and not damaged in shipping. Whether the guitar is cheap or expensive, it is incumbent on the seller to make sure it works properly. Otherwise it is ok and a pleasure to play."

Extremely pleased with my recent purchase of a Xtreme Easy-Lift Hydraulic piano stool. I don't know why we hadn't looked into this earlier our daughters of varying ages had to constantly adjust the height on our old piano stool which took forever with the side screw knobs.
However adjustment with the hydraulic piano stool is instant. It's a very solid and well built unit that was extremely easy to assemble. The unit was well protected and packed in its box and the delivery service used was outstanding. I was kept up to date on the status of my order.

It was difficult to get a hold of the right person to ask specific questions about particular products. I was transferred from one phone line to another. Once I placed my order, email communication was good but two items that were out of stock were estimated to arrive by a certain date and this date was pushed back a number of times. I requested photos of one of the out of stock guitars before shipping because I wanted to see the wood grain before committing to it but staff failed to send me these photos before shipping. I'm not entirely happy with the wood grain I ended up with and probably would have chosen a different guitar if I had been sent photos as requested.

Excellent customer service. I had a problem with something I purchased online. The product was in perfect working order but the manufacturer's manual & website gave the the impression that it was compatible with my equipment when in reality it wasn't. Not the stores fault at all and yet they still refunded me. I really didn't expect that result.
Staff were also polite & friendly through the process.
I'd bought other things from Better Music previously with no problem.
Thanks to Morgan and the other staff at Better."

1126,5,2021-04-17T07:38:32.000Z,"I am the first lucky owner of a Maestro‚Ä¶
I am the first lucky owner of a Maestro Project X1TE acoustic Travel guitar. The guitar is built exceptionally well (made of a solid sitka spruce top and mahogany back and sides).
This instrument is beautiful and has an amazingly big sound for its compact sized 00 body. This guitar literally sang to me the minute it was played due to how exquisite it sounds and its build quality.
I would recommend this Maestro guitar to anyone who wants an excellent compact acoustic guitar at a good price.
The guitar came with a free gig bag too! I found the neck really streamlined and easier to play than the competing brands, Yamaha and Maton. I would also say the sound is very on par with the Mini Maton guitar without the price tag.
This guitar is amazing value for money!!! Thanks to Simmo as well who took great care of me. I will definitely be back to see Simmo when I go back to Better Music in future! Thanks very much for taking the time to find a guitar that suited my needs and for being so helpful.

Quite slow to dispatch online order (4 days after purchase) and required a credit card verification refund/recharge before sending. I understand there can be issues with credit but the timeline was not acceptable in my opinion.

The website also needs work, very difficult to navigate and load times were appalling given it's 2021. Multiple times I tried to purchase elsewhere but Better Music was the only service that had all the products I wanted in stock.

However, products eventually arrived in good condition and staff were friendly.

Unfortunately, I doubt I will be purchasing from here again in a hurry."

Great service. Had an eye on an amp head since late last year and with the pandemic situation it was going to be a problem to do a proper ETA. Gary was kind enough to keep me in the loop every month till it finally arrived 7 months later. Really happy with the service from Gary and also Bettermusic as a whole. I previously had a Hughes & Ketter import (before bettermusic became a dealer) which had problems and Bettermusic did the right thing by repairing it under warranty without me having to send it back to the country of import.

1251,3,2021-03-24T01:18:18.000Z,"Expensive product packed badly
The product is good. I have an older Petersen strobe that worked great, the new one is as good and even a little smaller.
The issue I have is the way it was sent. it was sent in an unpadded bag and the little box that the strobe tuner was in was crushed. for $100 I expected the tuner to at least come in a padded box or a padded bag at the very least. The original Petersen strobe that I have was actually bought in a metal box, and very well protected.
That is the reason for a 3 star rating the way it was packaged and sent to me.
Perhaps be more considerate of the way you package expensive items it wasn't a box of plectrums after all."

But.. I'd be lying if I said this pedal didn't sound great! It sounds amazing!

Order started 25 January - After using the online chat to ask what was waiting time for a keyboard amp (Behringer 900 FX) I was told I would be looking around the early part of February so I ordered the item online. Contacted Better Music again in mid Feb to be told now early March. Rang last week to check and was told 31 March. Cancelled order and reordered a Vox amp as it was available.....order was confirmed to be delivered last Friday 5 March. Order didn‚Äôt arrive until 9 March after I rang the StarTrack office. The order came with a sticker saying it wasn‚Äôt delivered because my house was closed for delivery ??? - no card was left. I appreciate that supply and delivery companies are not under Better Music‚Äôs control - the 3 stars were for the friendly service I received from Better Music. However You need to check your website and don‚Äôt offer goods you have no idea if and when they are going to turn up.

Better Music had excellent customer service, friendly knowledgeable staff and prompt communication. Their website is easy to navigate through an extensive range of products. Their prices are very competitive and in some cases much cheaper than other retailers. From the time I placed the order for a out of stock Audio-Technica LP120xBT-USB turntable in September, Better Music kept me up to date with its expected arrival in Australia. Once it arrived it was sent out the same day and I had it interstate within a couple of days with free delivery. I was very impressed with the technical advice I received and service provided. The Audio-Technica LP120xBT-USB is an excellent turntable that pairs up perfectly with Presonus Eris 3.5 BT studio monitors."

I bought a digital piano from better music in early November 2020, and was advised immediately after my purchase that it was on back order and not due to arrive in Australia until January 2021. I appreciated this swift communication, and they also gave me the option of opting out due to the long wait. I decided to continue with the purchase. Overall, communication with better music was a positive experience, the only criticism would be that I had to keep calling better music for updates on the shipment when it got closer to its arrival. However, I appreciate that this was difficult due to the supplier not updating their status. But once better music received the relevant information they were great with passing that on to me. My biggest grievance would be that they used TNT for the delivery, who I found to be extremely unreliable and provided me with zero communication when they missed the expected delivery date. When they did eventually deliver my piano, they left the empty pallet in the middle of my backyard, which I feel is very unprofessional. I would suggest if better music can avoid using TNT in the future, that would be advisable!"

I ordered a music stand and mutes online from Better Music. Choosing a music stand was helped by an excellent video on the website which described some of the pros and cons of some the stands which Better Music stocked. The service was prompt and the goods were delivered only a couple of days later. Everything was safely packed and all is working as expected. The only reason for not giving a five star review was that I encountered problems paying with my credit card on the site. I tried two different cards from two different banks, one of which I use frequently and had never had problems with before. Fortunately, alternative payment modes were offered and I did a bank transfer which was successful. I'm not sure what caused this problem but it felt mildly frustrating at the time."

I purchased around $1500 of items from better music. The delivery came within the time frame but all the boxes are really damaged - I mean, it's really bad. There is evidence of the boxes being opened and repacked/resealed and attemptd to repair them with scrap cardboard and sticky tape. It crushes your desires to believe you have purchased new items that have been cared for from the manufacture to your home when boxes look like this. Equally disappointing is that the sales team have not responded to me for two days now and counting. So I can't open or use my stuff and have no one to talk to about it..."

I'm a little disappointed that I spent nearly $3000 and still had to fork out $50 for shipping. There was a large free shipping sign on the page, but that doesn't include so-called remote areas. I live in a capital city, which I wouldn't call a remote area. Still a minor grumble.

1722,1,2021-01-11T00:42:49.000Z,"Missing item and badly packaged delivery
I have purchased a Yamaha P125B with all accessories with the bag, portable keyboard stand, timber stand , pedal , stool and bag to support my son for his love of music. Ordering it online is a huge mistake. First the timber stand was oversold and I was informed will not be available until February 2021. I was cool with it because I have also order the KS166 keyboard stand anyway. The delivery arrived in badly shaped box with dents and one of the box has ripped that the item inside are showing. Worst of all, they missed to send the KS166 stand although it is included in the invoice send with the package. I have called them immediately to inform. I have send the photo of the boxes. Better music mentioned the piano should be fine and it has a 5 year warranty anyway but offer to send in a new one. Who wants to spend time trying to claim a warranty because the piano you order go through somersault and trauma on the delivery. I have decided to decline as I can no longer trust that similar issue will not occur on the new shipment. The way they package the 4 boxes are extraordinary. All 4 boxes worth 32kg, with the Yamaha P125B along with its accessories are wrap together in a large black rubbish bag . The piano box are squeeze between the bag and stool box. And it wasn‚Äôt wrap all the way around. Only just the half of the total length of the largest box. I didn‚Äôt see any note for handle with care. It was also uneven as the stool was in the center of the wrapping it has dragged down the plastic bag exposing the boxes and stripping some of it. I have voice the way they package the boxes together and tried to suggest an improvement taking into consideration as well the one person delivery guy who will have to drag the boxes out of his van full of other parcels. However, the person I was speaking to mentioned that‚Äôs how they send the package. And they send hundreds of them. I wish all their future customer good luck with that kind of packaging. The team I was dealing to are initially very responsive with the return arranging a pick up. But they are probably busy now to respond with my follow up."

The Better music web site was quite straight forward to use and allowed secure payment, seemed to take a little while longer than i expected to be shipped via Aust post but did arrive within the time limits stated. Aust post tracking started out telling me it was shipped from ACT to Qld and Expecting delivery at red bank plains Qld, and there it stayed for days. Then found the delivery in the letter box. So only really let down by Australia Post Tracking Information which they seem to get 1 out of 10 right."

2024,5,2020-11-28T02:21:47.000Z,"Ordered Yamaha YCL-255 clarinet for 10yo
I ordered a Yamaha YCL-255 clarinet for my daughter. She is 10yo and has been learning on a hired clarinet for a year. After speaking to a couple of clarinet teachers, they were unanimous that this was the best choice for someone at her level and also living in tropical Darwin. The pros are that this model is light, durable (including in heat and humidity), and produces a good sound but is still very affordable. The ordering process was easy - I also added cork grease, a clarinet stand, a cleaning cloth, some reeds, and some sheet music.

I discovered when I got the order that the YCL-255 comes packaged with a cleaning cloth and a small container of cork grease - so FYI you don't need to order extra. The case is very nice, but reasonably large. It has plenty of room for extra reeds and bits and pieces, but she won't be able to fit much else in her school backpack if she tries to put this case inside it. It has its own shoulder strap, though, so she can just carry it separately.

The clarinet is a Christmas present so she hasn't had a chance to try it out yet, so this review is not based on the sound or playability of this particular clarinet. Better Music delivered the product as ordered to a business address and it was in excellent condition when it arrived - everything was in sturdy cardboard boxes packaged in waterproof lining."

The Yamaha NP32 replaced an old Casio CTK-800 61 note keyboard which was having compatibility problems with Windows 10 due to outdated drivers.

The new keyboard is perfect with the Playground Sessions online course I'm enrolled in & is light & portable enough to take to the music group at the local Men's Shed.

The service from Better Music was excellent & I highly recommend them."

Better Music was great to purchase from and they were prompt in getting my order ready. It is a Christmas present, so it will be a little while before the product is actually used.

My only negative comment is around the courier. I live in a terrace where my front door opens directly on the footpath. My husband and I were home all day the day my purchase was delivered and there was never a knock on the door (my husband works in the front room of the house and always hears a knock). I became aware that my purchase had been delivered only when I was checking my email and it said that delivery had occurred and I had apparently even signed for it. I started to panic wondering where it had been delivered to, when my husband thought to look outside - there was my big parcel just left sitting on the public footpath. Not very happy at all with the courier."

2210,4,2021-12-19T14:09:26.000Z,"Great service‚Äîshame about the product
I have always experienced great service shopping at Better Music, and, with one exception, I have been completely satisfied with every product I have ever purchased there. This review is mainly about the one exception, an Xtreme AP25 tablet holder, two annoying faults of which I believe potential buyers of this product should be made aware. I strongly suspect that the Xtreme AP24 will suffer from the same faults. Although I have never owned one of the latter, the AP25 appears to be just an AP24 with an extra pair of attachments which allow it to accommodate larger tablets.

I bought my AP25, which comes with a 1-year warranty, from Better Music on October 10, 2018. About 18 months later, in March 2020, the clamping nut which locks the device against rotation around its side-to-side horizontal axis failed to operate. The problem was that the thread on the bolt holding the nut had worn down so much that the latter would no longer fasten. If it had been easy and cheap to replace this bolt, it would not have bothered me at all. Unfortunately, the bolt is a 5mm carriage bolt, which are rare as hen's teeth. I was unable to find any place in Australia which stocked them. Although I could have imported one from overseas, the cost of doing so wasn't much less than that of buying an entirely new AP25.

Replacing the carriage bolt with an ordinary hex-headed 5mm bolt enabled me to continue using the product, but this wasn't very satisfactory. Whenever the nut became loose enough to allow free rotation around the relevant axis, finger-tightening was insufficient to secure it, and it was necessary to use a spanner. Eventually I did manage to find a satisfactory solution by soldering an allen key into the head of a 5mm allen bolt, which allowed the nut to be sufficiently tightened using just the fingers.

About two months after this adventure, a similar fate befell the bolt that clamps the device onto a music or microphone stand. This time, the bolt was an 8mm wing bolt, which turned out to no easier to find than a 5mm carriage bolt. Fortunately, the good folk at Specialty Fasteners were able to suggest a satisfactory alternative‚Äîa multiple lobed clamping nut screwed tightly onto one end of an 8mm grub screw.

Unfortunately, the bracket through which the wing bolt and its replacement were screwed is made of much softer metal than the high tensile steel of the replacement. Thus, after about a year or so of further operation, the hole through which this bolt was screwed was widened so much that the bolt could simply slid back and forth through it and would no longer fasten the bracket to my music stand. The fix I adopted this time was to superglue a 5mm stainless steel hex nut over the hole, and this has so far enabled me to continue using the product."

I was expecting 4-6 days shipping but I received my guitar the next day! The thing I found most impressive is how polite and friendly the staff is over the phone.

I recently bought a mini maton ( diesel ) from better music. Having previously owed one ( my old mini was lost in a house fire ) I knew exactly what the guitar was going to be like so I started shopping around locally ( Perth ) and the only one I tracked Down was over $2000 so I started looking elsewhere. That‚Äôs when I came across Better music, they had the best price and reasonable shipping to Perth so I started the check out process which was smooth and easy to navigate. The mini was ordered on a Thursday evening ,the shop would have been closed and it arrived on the Tuesday and was traceable along its journey, super fast shipping from over the other side of the country. The only problem I have is not with better music but with the courier person. I arrived home to find my $1600 guitar sitting at my front door in plain sight of every passer bye to see, I live in a fairly good neighbourhood but it could easily have been stolen. The guitar packaging was fantastic , nothing was going to be damaged during transit & once I‚Äôd unpacked the mini and tuned her up it was like being reunited with an old friend. Before I decided on the mini maton diesel I tried the Martin‚Äôs and Taylor‚Äôs in the same category but settled with the maton, Australian made and they really do build a fantastic product.
Thanks for your great price and excellent service.

Why am I leaving a five star review? Better Music has a wonderful website that's easy to navigate and they have a vast range of products to choose from. I was able to find what I wanted at excellent prices. Better Music dispatched and delivered my purchased items fast and free. They also included a thank you card, which they wrote on, by hand and they took care to write my name correctly (this really means a lot to me.) All in all I had a wonderful experience and would recommend Better Music to anyone."

Second time I‚Äôve bought something from Better Music. Both times I‚Äôve been very happy with the whole process. On the most recent order where my item had gone out of stock shortly after I completed it online, the communication from them was excellent. The item turned up earlier than expected anyway. The prices are fantastic and are definitely the main reason I‚Äôll be going back to Better Music every time. Cheers."

The website listed an item in stock which wasn't. I think that's technically illegal according to the ACCC.

It's probably more prominent because the item I was after was listed as out of stock on a few other sites and I picked better music specifically because the site indicated the item was in stock.


Otherwise it was a positive experience, good communication from the store indicating their was a delay because the item is not in stock, free delivery to VIC because of lockdown which is awesome. Website was easy to use and prices were the same as others."

I was disappointed, however, that it took a full week to arrive. In the past I have received items in just a couple of days. Perhaps this is more of an Australia Post issue than a problem at the Better Music end of the supply chain!

Simply a great company to deal with. I made an error on my ordering regarding shipping and I received a call from them the next day to clarify and fix it. It was nearly lunch time and they said it will be sent the following day. I told them how my daughter needed the mic as soon as possible and they went the extra yards to send it that afternoon!

Outstanding. We will only order from Better Music now."

2562,5,2020-09-15T04:13:25.000Z,"These guys are not ""BETTER MUSIC"", they are ""BEST MUSIC!!!""
Sep 2020 I live in Fitzroy, Melbourne and was desperate to buy an official ROLAND Z-shaped stand for my Roland keyboard. I couldn't find any in stock in Melbs. But the BETTER MUSIC in Sydney website indicated they had them. ""Nah, it won't be accurate."" I thought. The price was on par with the best prices from the competitors, too. Plus FREE POSTAGE!!! It sounded too good to be true!!! I figured, ""Ok, let's take a chance."" So, I can now report that my experience was AMAZING!!! In comparison to other purchases I've made during Lockdown - of which there have been many!!! hehehehe - this was one of the fastest - and BETTER MUSIC is not even in my State of Victoria. The emails I received from the team to confirm my purchase and then that the stand was on its way are the most professional I have ever received! The team takes a down-to-earth and personalised approach to what is likely an automated message - but that's not how the messages make you feel. I'm not going to reveal their secret - that's something you will experience for yourself when you buy something from them!!!! I'm now a BETTER MUSIC FAN - and I will turn to the team there for my music production needs long before I look to any of the local music stores in Melbourne. Thanks from DJ Boo in Fitzroy!!!"

Fast service. The purchase was the best price I found through my research on the internet. The online ordering was straight forward and noted how many items were in stock. I rang to ask a question of the online purchasing process, as I am a novice. The phone support was not completely accurate with information but the person I spoke with was pleasant. The incorrect information did not impact on my process in any way. I was able to navigate through the online ordering process and I received my purchase in the minimum time frame suggested on the website. ie 4 - 10 days. It was at my house 4 days after purchasing! This was unexpected and an exciting moment! I have confidence to shop with Better Music in the future."

The shipment was so fast it was surprising, especially with a bulky item like an electric piano. The piano itself was pure quality, loving it right now. However, the reason for a 4 star would be the package. I could tell after receiving the package, that it's been through some rough times. There were dents and rips in the cardboard package but no scratches on the product itself (which is good).

If the packaging could be handled with a little bit more care, this would definitely be a 5-star experience."

I placed my on order on that same afternoon of 1 September.

By the way, the bench (RPB-100BK) that came with it wouldn't close properly. I came across the same complaint from other reviewers. I guess it's not BetterMusic's fault so I'm still happy to give them 5 stars."

Order Boss Waza Air headphones for $699, Belfield Music had stock next day for about $590ish or so. I asked if they can price match Belfield, but they said no.

Fair enough, they are under no obligation to price match after the sale was done, but I hoped they would look after the customer and price match. I buy quite a bit of pedals and guitar gear and would have continue to buy from these guys but unfortunately I won't be able to recommend them after this and will vote with my wallet and buy from somewhere else, which is a shame.

Edit:
Extra info based on store reply, I can add Belfield music Waza Air to cart right now, they have had stock for over a week already, I understand if there is no stock then asking for a price match is crazy, but the stock is there.

And of course you can price match on that, just takes a call or email to the accounting department to do a partial refund on order XYZ to customer ABC, then you'd have someone who wouldve said ""Damn these guys went above and beyond to look after a customer, didnt have to do it but they did it anyway, I'm gonna tell all my mates to buy from here and the next time I want to purchase a pedal or a guitar I'll go directly to them! they won my business""

2781,2,2020-08-24T07:16:05.000Z,"Unprofessional response to a faulty product shipped
I recently purchased an Audio-Technica turntable from this business. The product was shipped to me in a faulty condition - it was a major fault (only one channel worked). When I asked them how to return the product for a refund, their response was that I may have set up the device incorrectly. They supplied a youtube clip showing setup instructions. If that did not work, I was to take it to a local repairer to have the device repaired under warranty. Those were my two options.

That is a clear breach of consumer law. A refund MUST be one of the options for a major fault in a product. I am still considering making a complaint to the ACT Fair Trading.

Further, there was no apology in their initial email response to me. The excuse I received was that they were busy trying to resolve the issue quickly. They did not even show me courtesy by giving me a quick phone call.

They could have arranged to pick up the device, have it repaired, and offered me some form of compensation or goodwill. No, they only offered to collect it for repair after I complained to them about their unsatisfactory response.

I would have given them one star but decided to give them two, only because they did ship the device to me quickly and when I complained and asked for the contact details of the CEO, that was supplied to me promptly.

The only good thing to happen out of all this was that I had to take the device to Brisbane Sound Group for repair. I had not been in that store before. It was awesome, and they have all the types of studio recording gear that I need and use. They were really polite and professional too. I will be shopping there in the future.

P.s This is in response to Better Music's response to the above.

The repairer has not fixed the device yet. You know that because I have sent emails to representatives from your business (today) explaining that the repairer requires authorisation from Audio-Technica first, then once approved it will take 3-5 working days to repair after that.

Be honest and post accurate information. I have. You are trying to up-play your willingness to resolve the issue and make excuses for the poor resonse I received from your organisation when I first raised concerns about receiving a faulty product."

I was really happy with how easy it was to order one line. I was pleased at how quickly I received my keyboard but unfortunately I didn't receive the stand that I ordered to go with it.
I rang to ask what had happened and I was told that someone would get back to me in 15 minutes. I rang back after an hour and was told that the keyboard would be sent to me. So disappointing.
I can see what caused the stand problem. It doesn't come up as a separate line item if you click it as a suggestion (want to add a stand?) it just adds the cost to the overall total. I wouldn't have been so cross if I hadn't had to ring back.Just tell me it may take a little time to sort out and I still would have been happy.

After going to a guitar store after testing it the day it was delivered, even the technician there couldn't fix the buzz. The only thing that semi worked was replacing the factory string with a new string, and that seemed to help a bit. It's still prevalent, especially if you strum loudly, but it's overall kind of playable.

The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the item I originally ordered was actually out of stock and this was not indicated on their website at the time of ordering. However the very next day the they were in contact with me to provide the timeframe for the new stock to arrive and also suggested an alternative product which was in stock, and were prepared to answer any questions I had. When I decided to change my order to the alternative product, the process was seamless, and the goods arrived promptly, I would not hesitate in using Better Music in the future."

Good prices, and although I ordered something that was out of stock, I received a message explaining this situation and expected delivery, also asking if I wished to proceed with the order.
However, when the expected delivery date came and went, by nearly a month, I queried my order. The next thing I knew it was being dispatched, though a response to my query would have been nice, even if just an automated, stock reply. I have just received my order today, nearly four weeks later than anticipated.
Please work on your customer service skills as this is what makes people happy to buy again. Letting a customer know that there's been more of a delay than originally anticipated would have given me more options."

TC bass head - I spent a lot of time online looking for the best price. USA, UK and Germany included. UK was $50 cheaper but no warranty in Australia. Found one store in Oz but none in stock plus shipping charges.
Better Music had stock and the best price and free shipping (and warranty).
Ordered 11pm Monday and the amp was in my hands Friday by noon.
In this case, I found Better Music to do the best deal in the world. Faultless."

3183,2,2020-07-07T05:07:27.000Z,"Won‚Äôt bother again.
My daughter needed a new violin urgently after a school vandalism incident, looked at online ordering which seemed easy, we opted for click and collect which indicated it would be ready in 1-2 business days. Happy with that, so proceeded and paid.
Got an email a day later advising part of our order had to be shipped in...(online said it was all available...hence why we ordered) so there would be a delay of 3-5 business days. Not happy. Wouldn‚Äôt have ordered this item had we known it would be so slow to collect!!!
Then, we went to pick up the violin and amp, the guy at the counter told me to call the online order line myself because they were busy. My face must have said it all because he made the call himself. Waited about ten minutes and then he walked over, handed us the boxes, sold us a cord to connect and that was it. Don‚Äôt think he smiled once, and acted like we were an imposition for being there. Would have been nice if they‚Äôd showed us the instrument and gave my daughter a run through on its features (she‚Äôs upgraded to an electric model) before sending us on our way. We‚Äôll go to DW music in Fyshwick in future, much better customer service and they‚Äôve always been prompt in delivery."

Pretty disappointed with my experiences with Better Music. I had poor customer service and issues with the stock I ordered. All info I got about the status of my order was by chasing them. I ordered two 500 series modules online, then was told only one was in stock after paying. The second one was then ordered from their supplier, and although the supplier itself was very slow, I was not kept in the loop and it took another week and a half to ship. Once both arrived, the two modules were different model numbers, looked entirely different, and one was missing a knob! To their credit, they ordered a replacement and didn't require me to ship the damaged one until I received this, but ordering again from the same slow supplier, this took forever and I was again forced to nudge them every few days for info. Emails were not responded to so I had to call them multiple times. The module has now been replaced but I never received an apology for the mixup or damaged stock."

Would highly recommend Better Music and will definitely buy from them again. Thanks Guys."

Better Music were reasonable values for the purchased and when the confirmation delivery dates to the customer and always on time. The Gears were right as advertised online.
Once not much satisfied was the item advertised in-stocks when place on order then the answers need to wait for the supplied for 2-4 dates arrived then delivered to the customer. A bit confused about in-stocks meaning was stocks in store and ready to shipped or in-stocks meaning was waiting for the supplier later after received to shipped out.
However, Better music still good as trustworthy to purchase the music instrument from them"
3252,3,2020-06-30T07:09:28.000Z,"I‚Äôd give 3.5 stars
I‚Äôd give 3.5 stars. I‚Äôve purchased from BM before and it was smooth but this time was a little average. First of all, one of the items was in backorder. After nearly a month, I emailed to find out that staff forgot to notify me stock is back. When I went to collect my order, after waited in line (long queue) only to be told I was meant to be the other side of the shop. A small sign that says Online Order Pick-Up will suffice. So I went to the other side of the shop, waited again, the staff in the storeroom need some self-awareness training. He looked at me and then went back packing his orders instead of asking me if I needed help. After about 5 mins, by now I was feeling frustrated. Supposed to be easy when I‚Äôm just collecting my order. I went back to the main queue and asked for someone to help me. He walked to the ‚Äúcollect point‚Äù and then this dude in the storeroom finally appeared and asked if I needed help! My mind was blown at this point. He then found my order but I asked what happened to the item I was told has arrived?! He responded the item hasn‚Äôt arrived but would call me when it arrived. I went home and emailed the guy who told me the item had arrived. This guy replied ‚Äúit‚Äôs right next to your drum head which you picked up‚Äù! Ugh! This dude in the storeroom seriously need his eyes checked! I said I won‚Äôt return again since I was there. The guy was nice and offered to post it to me. I received it without delay which was great. Hence 3.5 stars. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd order online anymore. I‚Äôd like to support local business but it was an unpleasant experience for sure."

Very happy with experience. The item I wanted was not available due to shortages and I was asked if I‚Äôd like to replace with a similar item. I spoke to a store expert and decided to wait for my original order.

""5. Due to COVID-19 health reasons all opened items are ineligible for return.""

You would think this is flagged to customers in their email confirmation, but its hidden in the fine print.

Hope this helps someone rethink their purchase. Maybe buy from somewhere that allows you a grace period to try the instrument."

I ordered a Roland KS-10z keyboard stand online, and for some inexplicable reason forgot to put the unit number of my address! When I received the invoice and realised, I emailed them and they replied within minutes to say they'd updated it, (thanks Morgan!) Sure enough it arrived to the right address! Their communication was great, they also personally let me know by email when new stock of the stand was expected to arrive, (thanks Eric!), and it actually ended up being delivered weeks before I had anticipated. I highly recommend Better Music. Also the stand is absolutely awesome - super easy to put together and very sturdy. Just as I hoped!"

Purchased a gator guitar pedalboard online for $399.

I requested to return (I had opened the box saw it was a very badly made and possibly a second. Certainly does is not worth $399, And called better music straight away. I had not used at it all . I was told by Better Music that I had to pay return postage (very heavy item) and also pay 20%restocking fee. All of which would not give me much back and not worth returning. I would never purchase anything from this store. I have found other music stores online with excellent after sales service who would pay return postage if not satisfied with purchase.

3508,4,2020-05-29T06:12:42.000Z,"Great customer service, shame about the shipping
Ordered my stuff online with no problems. Had a few bumps with stock levels but the friendly staff sorted it out really quickly. Top notch service.

The problems came after this. Shipping. Had nothing but troubles with the courier service. Received messages saying it will be turning up and it didn‚Äôt. Got to about 3 in the afternoon and still waiting. I called the courier to check and was told it was on it‚Äôs way, then 5 minutes later was sent a message saying it had failed. Called them again and they said it wasn‚Äôt delivered to the service centre till late. Can‚Äôt dispatch it so late in the day.

Had to wait over the weekend to get it and it came late in the afternoon while I was at work (I‚Äôm a night worker). Luckily I had some one there to get it for me.

Opened the package once I got home and it looked like the box had been used in an football grand final. Bumps and torn cardboard everywhere. Wasn‚Äôt impressed.

In all fairness I know that the couriers part isn‚Äôt really controlled by Better Music so I probably should put most of this review to the courier company. However since they are the courier that was chosen I feel they need to be informed about what happens to their products after they are on the way to the customer.

As said Better music is top notch with their customer service. It‚Äôs just a shame that the courier service let them down over all."

Then when I received my order, I was so pleased, it was exactly as described, and I haven't been able to stop playing my instrument since it arrived on my doorstep! Once it shipped, the shipping process was so fast too! Very pleased customer and I will definitely be back if I ever need anything related to music/instruments again. Thank you so much Better Music!"

Very happy with the keyboard I purchased even though I had to wait around a month for it to arrive; to be fair the keyboard was out of stock when I ordered it online and due to the current pandemic I was informed that shipping might be delayed. I was happy to wait and I'm glad I waited. Communication via email with the team at Better Music was also delayed due to the vast amount of orders they were receiving but they answered the phone promptly when I wanted to upgrade my keyboard. Overall, I had a good experience and would order from them again if need be."

The Guitar (Yamaha FSX5) that was sent to me is pretty good and setup well, just not happy with the quality of finish of the side of the neck where fretboard meets the body. It's a bit messy (bubbly) which I don't expect on a $2000 guitar. Hopefully Yamaha can address this."

Purchased a Line 6 Amplifi TT from the website - the store had the best price, and a good writeup on the website, so I wanted one - Really Glad I got it as well - it's an awesome piece of Desktop Kit.

Delivery was slower than normal due to the COVID-19 situation, which was fair enough - The ONLY gripe I could really say I had was the product was labelled ""In Stock"" when it actually wasn't - so for a few extra days I was excited for the product that wasn't actually in stock at the time. BUT - it was only an additional few days, and would have been a more realistic experience if I knew the stock was somewhat on backorder - but all that said, it wouldnt distract me from buying further gear from here. The shipping from the store itself was express, which balanced it all out OK.Other than that, I dont regret the purchase at all - the Amplifi-TT is AWESOME!"

I was planning on writing an email for you guys. I absolutely loved the way you communicated with me, the guitar brought me so much joy and I was surprised it got to me before the 4-10 days term. I know it can be difficult in times like this to feed the demand and not get stressed out, but I'd like to say that you are doing a great job, and I can testify it. I felt that not only my needs were met, but that I was cared for, I didn't feel like I was just a client.
That's pretty much it, it was worth the wait, now I can write my songs and play all day thanks to you, so thank you one more time.

3745,5,2020-05-12T04:27:16.000Z,"Best customer service I've experienced.
Best customer service I've experienced.

I've been a customer of Better Music for approximately 10 years. As a customer, I've never received better care, attention, and professional advice from a service or store as I have from the staff at Better Music. The staff there are highly professional, knowledgeable, and experienced industry professionals eager to assist & aid every customer in finding what they are searching for.

Over the many years of being a customer there, I've put in orders for some items which are extremely difficult to track down & order. The staff have tirelessly searched for the product I am after and have delivered it at a fair price; despite the time it took to organise its delivery.

No matter what your budget, desire, situation, or dilemma, you can count on Better music to deliver a great & fair customer experience. There's a good reason I haven't gone to any other store for a decade. James in drums/high tech has always looked after and gone above and beyond for me."
3746,2,2020-05-08T05:49:11.000Z,"Pretty disappointed
Pretty disappointed. Ordered a guitar and then was later told that it was out of stock and it wouldn‚Äôt be available until mid-July??
I was only please with the fact that I got a refund but I‚Äôm still waiting for my other products I ordered nearly a month ago.
I decided to order my guitar elsewhere and it still came literally the next day-it was also from interstate. I understand COVID-19 has its delays but I‚Äôve ordered a lot of products and none of them take this long. Honestly not at all happy with my experience."
3747,2,2020-05-08T03:43:03.000Z,"Shipping time
Shipping time was pretty ridiculous for a pack of picks, obviously covid-19 is effecting this most places but if your ordering during this covid madness that‚Äôs just the truth. On a lighter note the guitar picks are good, but then again, it‚Äôs hard to stuff a guitar pick up. \m/"
3748,3,2020-05-08T03:55:43.000Z,"Didn't Blow My Socks Off
Very delayed shipping (due to store being inundated with orders during Covid). Someone should have been contacting customers to let them know when approx despatch date would be. After 9 days I had to phone in to get an update. Express Courier was used once the despatch finally took place.
The packaging was OK (not great) .The Epiphone Les Paul guitar arrived in good condition. However when I checked the guitar set up, I saw that it was not what the factory claimed string clearances had been set to. Was this due to poor QA at the factory ? No set up check at Better Music before despatch ? Or rough handling and mediocre packaging during transit? Who knows?
When an online sale is made (I'm inter-state), and it is obviously not possible for the customer to bring the instrument in for a professional set-up, I think it is doubly important that the instrument set up be carefully checked prior to despatch. This was a bit disappointing. Even with Covid there is no excuse. Definitely something for Better Music to address. Luckily the set up was easy enough to correct. Overall I am happy with the purchase, even though it was not ideal, so I will give 3 stars. Some people would give this experience a lot less."

3782,2,2020-05-05T09:06:54.000Z,"Bass guitar lost in warehouse
Purchased one Yamaha trbx174 with the tuner and carry bag, one bass strap and instrument cable.
Waited about 1 week, with it stuck at processing. So emailed and was assured it had been processed, and was just waiting to be shipped. Happily I waited another 2 business days for the shipping information and it was still not marked as shipped. At this point it has been from the 24/04 till the today the 5/05. Still stuck at processing.

So I ended up calling. Customer service was prompt and professional. However they looked into it and proceeded to inform me that, they had lost the bass guitar in the warehouse and had been looking for it. I was told, I could wait a month or have a refund. While I truly wanted the to learn the bass as I had everything else, a month is too long given university will start up soon in june.

The reason for the poor rating was the fact that, I understand the situation has increased the time we all have to wait. However being uninformed of the situation, or incorrectly informed the first time, means that it was more time lost. And sadly, that is the biggest let down, because I was genuinely looking forward to this one shipment and these guys have a very good reputation. Just wish I had not felt ignored. As of currently, all the other bass coloured variants of the trbx174, I wanted were sold out, which is such a shame as I liked 3 different ones and ended up picking my favourite. However if I was informed earlier there were others available until recently. Yet the lack of communication and time, meant that they were sold out over the past nearly 2 weeks and that there was also no way to get it even in the other 2 colours variants maybe.

Apologies for the honest rant, just feeling pretty down about it all. I am certain when things go right, these guys are amazing, but wanted to share this experience, incase anyone else has a similar one. It is super rare I am sure, very unfortunate it seems. Just wish there were more options after all this time spent hopeful and excited."

Took 5 days to send the product right before the weekend after ordering prior to Monday. Could have had it much sooner if the store acted upon the order sooner.

The product did not look brand new, but that may simply be the case when buying Roland cymbals, not quite sure. It took a bit of fiddling to get it triggering right though. I am in the end satisfied, and the cymbal does look great after a good clean with aerospace-grade rubber protection.

I hope to have orders shipped out the first business day following the order, and failing that, it shouldn't be too hard to pack and send on business day 2. The low score is due to the 5 business days taken to send."

3926,3,2020-04-29T19:56:03.000Z,"Check to see if an Item is In Store.
While this purchase was initially delayed as the Item was listed as being in Stock, it wasn't, it was actually at the supplier.
As a Customer when I see ""In Stock"" I assume that means the store has the item in Their Stock, well Buyer beware.
Apparently, in the Retail world ""In Stock"" and ""In Store"" mean two different things.
So you need to check with the Store to see if they have it on their shelf or they have to get it from their Supplier.
So there was a delay in getting my Item from the Supplier.
Once Better Music had the Item they sent it that day and I was given a Tracking number.
Unfortunately Startrack did not follow the instructions given to them by Better Music and Startrack delivered it to the wrong place.
A Big thanks to Better Music, they tracked my item down and I finally got the item.
The item was well packed and it arrived intact.
The item itself is great.
So while my purchase did not go 100% to plan, Better Music did their best to rectify the initial delay.
I thank them for that."

3941,3,2020-04-21T00:18:25.000Z,"My experience with the delivery of a parcel.
I recently bought a piano keyboard to be sent to a family member for a significant birthday. Luckily the parcel arrived on the actual birthday but not after a lot of stress for me.
I placed the order on 7th April and it wasn't shipped out of Better Music warehouse until the 14th April. It then sat at the shipper's premises (Star Track) in Canberra, until the Thursday 17th and arrived in Brisbane on Friday 18th. Fortunately it was finally delivered on Monday 20th - the day of the birthday.
I was concerned about this slow movement as I had paid an extra $36 for express delivery which was stated as 1 - 4 days. I doubled this time line in my mind because of the current situation but the I don't believe I was given any preference as an ""express"" customer.
This is perhaps the fault of Star Track (Australia Post) as I have had other slow deliveries recently - as a mother and grandmother I am sending lots of parcels and am disappointed that Australia Post hasn't been able to rise to the occasion as it were.
Perhaps also Better Music could have gotten my purchase out of the warehouse faster than one week. Or perhaps Better Music should take down the ""Express Delivery"" option as this is plainly not happening.
Covid 19 is a dreadful thing for us all to be going through but I think some blame is being put on the situation that is not warranted.

3990,1,2020-04-14T09:29:01.000Z,"Lies and Processing.
So the website is straight up lying when it comes to stock. I have ordered from here twice now and both times I've been told that an item was out of stock despite it saying clear as day on the website it was in stock the time I purchased it (and even days later). Better yet, the first time I was told ""the item is out of stock as indicated on the website"" despite the website showing it as having stock at that very moment!

But at least that time I was emailed after contacting them online and told it was out of stock. This latest time despite trying to enquire about my order online a couple times, it wasn't until I called up to check where I got the answer ""apparently we are waiting for the ibanez which is weird"" direct quote. And he is right, it is weird because it was shown as in stock the day I purchased it, 2 days after, 6 days after (both online and in store, I have a screenshot with the date) it was only 8 days after my order that the site finally showed the guitar as being out of stock.

Now processing times. To be as fair as possible, my first order was in December so there is probably an increase in orders and there was the fires happening etc etc, so there is some slack to give there. Still, they didn't contact me to let me know what was going on, I wouldn't be shocked if they didn't actually see my order until I contacted them online, as it was quickly resolved after that.
This time I've ordered in the beginning of April 2020, so it's amid this Covid-19 situation and it's a larger order than last time, so again there is some slack to give there. But it's been damn near two weeks since I placed the order and it's still being processed. trying to get into contact with them online and I received no response, called up and I'm basically just told it's the suppliers fault and they'll chase it up and harass them and that's it. No talk about looking at a different option, no rough idea of when the guitar will arrive for them to ship it, nothing...

I really want to try and be reasonable especially now, but 12 days and it's still not processed? Ordered on the 2nd of april, it's the 14th as of writing this. I've ordered books (obviously not from this store) which came in under a week, this month... An SSD came in under a week from another damn country, and my order from this store still hasn't been processed. This just doesn't seem reasonable."

4034,2,2020-04-09T11:29:02.000Z,"""in stock"" actually does not mean anything
2 weeks from the order date of all ""in stock online"" items to final delivery using Express shipping (and the post actually did all they promised). First I got a message from the shop the next day after the order notifying me that the guitar was actually not in stock but on its way from the supplier and is expected within a week. Well, OK, coronavirus, etc, but normal shops usually just set ""backorder"" status to not create false expectations. The next fail was when I finally received the parcel 10 days after the order - everything except the guitar. Totally confused I called the shop to find out that they just ""forgot"" to send the guitar and promised to send it the next day. The next day they did not send it because of some missing paperwork. That was pretty much the worst customer experience ever. Two stars because I've eventually got everything (I actually started to worry about it after the third call to the shop)."

I've bought gear from Better Music both in-store, when visiting Canberra, and online, and either way the experience has been excellent. Buying online saves me the hassle of going into central Brisbane and then haggling to get a price match. II prefer to deal with retailers who are upfront about their 'real' prices, as Better Music are. My latest purchase arrived within 3 business days, despite me not opting for express delivery."
4324,5,2020-03-01T04:14:29.000Z,"Thanks for the quick service
Thanks for the quick service, I originally paid 400 dollars to Music City in cash and ordered the mic through them, after 2 weeks, it finely arrived but they refused to hand over the mic claiming that I had not paid them when I did pay up front to order the mic,, the shop said they will keep A record of the cash I paid but when I asked for a copy of the record she kept it and the security footage of me paying the 400, they refused to give me anything and said take us to court. So I had to buy the mic again so thanks for selling the mic 50 cheaper and the wonderful service you gave and being trustworthy... I will never walk into Music City in Cairns after they took $400 from me in such an underhanded way. Cheers... Rom."

I have made about 9 Purchases with Better Music, and each one has been a pleasure. I think one took a day or two longer than usual to despatch but still got to me within the week, which for myself is absolutely fine as I work away and come home on weekends. Overall, I cannot fault the service. Actually, towards the end of last year my wife was buying me a xmas present and rang Better Music direct and asked for a discount on the drum amplifier I was looking at and also got them to throw in a set of drumsticks, she's a good negotiator. I couldn't do that myself, but it shows they want to keep their customers happy and returning. One day I will be upgrading my Roland V Drums and will be buying from Better music for sure. Should get the wife to ring again to do the haggling hey. Thanks for the great service."

Was initially disappointed when we ordered an amazing looking Fender and it was actually out of stock and this meant a few weeks wait. However, Callum was really fantastic about it. He even arranged for us to get the guitar sent out Express post when it did come back in stock. It is a stunning guitar, the sound is much better than our last guitar that was bought from somewhere else. The price is by far the cheapest we saw from anywhere in Australia. The packaging seemed a little light on - however the guitar still arrived in beautiful condition and it was clear it had been quality control checked."

4421,5,2020-02-13T05:24:16.000Z,"G & L s-500 Tribute Electric Guitar Purchase
Bought a G & L s-500 Tribute Electric Guitar (made in Indonesia) unseen from Better Music's website. It was delivered within 2 days. Which was great! Store rang and warned me of marks on guitar. They gave me a pack of Elixer strings and a Gig Bag because of this. I haven't been able to see the marks...Big plus. They did say the guitar would be set up. It wasn't. It was fret buzzing on the whole neck. This is very common in music stores and unfortunate because it can turn you off very good guitars (when they are not set up). I set the guitar up properly and now I can't put it down.
The G & L s-500 Tribute Guitar's body and neck feel great! The pick ups sound amazing (aggressive spaghetti western/surf guitar/60s Soundtracks). The bass roll-off is fantastic for lead. The neck and bridge pick ups combined make a great clean sound! The Vibrato is very sensitive and is easy to use. The Nut needed some filing/cleaning up and lubing. The string tree will be replaced and for ease of use I will be putting in locking tuners. Once set up this guitar has become perfect for my needs. Thank you Better Music and G & L."

The product we ordered arrived in one piece and performs as hoped, the only reason for the average rating relates to Better Music's processes. If a product is put on back order I generally don't mind as long as I know that I will have to wait for it, and if there are issues with the supplier getting stock I totally understand but in all of this communication with the customer should be a priority! And when you say you are going to do something (such as send express post) to make up for the delay, make sure it actually happens! I think it was just the systems/processes that let me down as when I had contact with staff they were very pleasant."

I would have given 5 stars because of the very good customer service. OJ has been very supportive ever since the 1st time I inquired until I received my order. However, delivery service (Star Track) is 100% not okay that's why I'm reducing it to 3 stars. They notified me that the ETA is Jan 14 so I didn't go to work just to receive my guitar and the delivery didn't come. The next day it did come but that wonderful driver left the guitar just in front of our apartment's main entrance door and it has HOLES in the box. Remember that it is either very sunny or rainy. What if someone stole it? What if it gets wet or due to heat, the guitar was damaged? And in the status of my delivery tracking, it says 'Delivered and Signed'. Who the h*** signed that for me? I'm just waiting in my apartment, didn't go to work for the 2nd time just to receive that delivery and that awesome Star Track driver didn't even attempt to ring my unit. I suggest BetterMusic to consider on changing your courrier for a better overall service. Thanks!"

Very happy with the product and price seemed to be best deal on the market. Delivery was made in the expected time frame, so a good experience all round.

A couple of small things detracted slightly:
I did request that the freight company gave us warning of their impending arrival (to be able to divert our son from seeing his Xmas present get delivered), hopefully this request got passed on, but the drums arrived with no warning and my son was on the scene when the first package (hardware and bonys tom) arrived, spoiling his xmas day surprise. I rang to find out where the rest of it (5 pc drums) was, was told that the delivery was complete so I was a bit nervous for a day or so until the second delivery arrived just in time. Neither of these are major issues, and I know I ordered at the busiest time of year, but sometimes a small request re delivery can make or break a Xmas surprise, and incorrect info from freight company can cause much panic!

Overall though, everyone here is happy!"

Great service and quick delivery, but the product 'OnStage RS4000 Small Tiltback Amp Stand (For Small Practice Amps)' is probably the worst piece of engineering I have ever seen. How this stand is supposed to hold anything heavier than a few hundred grams is beyond me. Even if you tighten the screws a lot, the arms of the stand collapse as soon as you put weight on it and angle it backwards a tiny bit. As it would probably cost me more hassle and money to return, I will fix it myself. Maybe in the future, take your products out of the package and check if they are fit for purpose and don't stock them if they aren't. This product is scrap metal, at best."

EDIT: Below is my original review however, after posting I was contacted by Better Music and I say this without any hesitation, I was given probably the best customer service I have ever received. They took my comments and concerns seriously and then offered me compensation as well. I honestly was blown away with the way they handled it and would now happily shop there again. I am also changing my review from 2 stars to 4 as a reflection of how happy I am with the overall service. As a customer it's one thing to be unhappy, but when the retailer actually listens and makes an effort to fix things, that's great service. Great shop!

ORIGINAL REVIEW
I'm just disappointed with the service. I will admit 1 mistake I made. I did not see that 1 of the items I ordered was not currently in stock. (Poorly labeled IMO but that's another issue), but regardless, the online order process then allowed me to continue and qualify for free shipping. Then I received a phone call saying it wasn't in stock, had to wait, and also would not get free shipping anymore because they would have to send two packages. So I decided not to get the out of stock item and just get one item and pay the shipping. No real care or attempt to please me was given by the sales rep.
Then when my product arrived it was clearly either second hand or floor stock. Scratches, bent and incomplete packaging and rubber marks. Again, pretty disappointing. So I contacted them via email with my complaint and I still have not heard back from them. This is what pushed me over the line and made me write the review. Just seems to be a lack of care."

A great experience. I ordered a pedal that was out of stock. Better Music immediately contacted me to see if I wanted to wait until the new stock arrived or cancel the order. I was happy to wait. New stock was expected to arrive mid-December but I actually received it in the first week of the month. Very pleased with the service and the pedal arrived in perfect condition.
Great people to deal with."

Then I discovered that it had not been properly serviced at all, it came back worse. I returned it to the woman in charge there who said it would be corrected. She was very rude. I received it and later discovered that the problem had not been corrected.
I now send my flute to a proper specialist. Do not send your flute to Better Music for service as it will come back worse."

I was slightly concerned with what I originally thought was an excessively large package. But given that it was a small item (a guitar pickup), this was most likely a security measure to ensure that it didn't get lost or buried somewhere en route."

5036,3,2019-11-14T01:10:04.000Z,"Only order if item is listed as in store...
Website is well designed and clear and easy to use. However there isn't a relationship between their stock levels and what is referred to as ""on-line stock"". We ordered something that was ""in stock"" but then received an email that the item needed to be ordered in from the supplier and would take a month to arrive (knowing Ibanez, this probably would have been even more!). Fortunately it turned out they actually did have stock, but in the physical store and the two systems didn't talk to one another. So yes, received the guitar on-time but only because I had to intervene.

The guitar was supposedly checked before shipping out, however one of the volume pots was completely loose, as was the input jack. I had to fix these myself. Not a big job, but also not something you expect to have to do on a brand new item."

5168,1,2019-10-26T06:13:32.000Z,"Bait and switch email campaigns
Update: At the time the owner responded to this review, the guitar is still listed available for sale at the 'discounted' price of $2856.

The fact is Better Music advertised a product at $1899 in the lead up to a 'sale' event and when the sale went live, there was an item with the exact same name and description listed on the website at a ""discounted price"" of $2856. This is misleading advertising.

Original review:
=============
I received an email advertisement that listed several ""1 only"" bargains including an Ibanez JS2410 guitar for $1899 (listed at $2999 at the time) as part of a limited time ""Once a year sale"".

Lured by the significant discount, I logged in to the website at 9am when the sale opened. To my surprise, the same guitar was listed but only discounted at $2856.19.

Curious, I opened a chat with the friendly staff happy to help with my enquiry, that was until I enquired about the advertised price. I was asked to provide a screenshot of the email ad, which I promptly did. I was then told ""that guitar has been sold"". Fair enough.

I decided to check a few other items from the email advertisement. None of them even existed on the site. And at the time of writing, the guitar I was looking at is still available online, albeit at the much higher price of $2856.19.

It's disgusting that this unethical behaviour is becoming acceptable now. I've unsubscribed from the Better Music mailing list and won't be giving them any more money."

The only reason I didnt give 5 stars was that I made a phone enquiry before my purchase and the person who answered the phone sounded like someone who'd come off a late night gig the night before ( it was 9 am ! ) and when I asked to get put through to the string section I was put on hold for so long I gave up waiting .
Other than those minor things a generally good experience.

Just remind people a little joy goes a long way

Two related transactions: First I ordered a keyboard... to be honest communications were a bit shabby (spelling and formatting errors in emails, no reply to one that I sent). Five days after collecting it I wanted to exchange it as it was a big disappointment. Service was perfectly friendly, and I thought the $30 was *reasonably* acceptable but was disappointed that it still applied even though I was upgrading the sale by exchanging it for a model that cost $100 more. Double-disappointed that when I got it home it appeared to have been opened before (the foam sleeve was crumpled and there were a few marks on it). No problem, but still ...to pay a restocking fee and then pay full price for an apparently re-stocked keyboard made me say 'hmmm'. Also just for the information of staff: You don't have to register the Yamaha PSR-E463 to get a 3 year warranty, as of March 2019 you get a five year warranty with no registration now. Overall ...not offensive in any way, just very unremarkable."

Thank You! I recently bought an Arturia Keylab 88 for an amazing price from your site (hundreds cheaper than your competitors), but after buying I didn't realize the listed product was the older version.

Checking next day I noticed the link was gone (so it must have been an old product/dead link, hence why it was so cheap), that said, not only did you honour it, but you sent me the all-new whiz bang Mk II version which is downright amazing! I wasn't expecting that.. Thank you so much!

Will be back!"

I was not informed that the stock had to be ordered after I communicated with one of your costumer service consultants.
I had to wait for about 2weeks to receive my item and when I received the item, the condition of the package was out of shaped and part of the box was broken. It was a miracle that the instrument was not damaged. I also asked you guys to tune the item but nothing was done.
(But apart from all the dramas, I appreciate that you refunded me the Express shipping fees but again, it was not possible for you guys to deliver the item in 1-4days after the order)"

5391,4,2019-09-11T01:53:37.000Z,"The purchasing process went easy and‚Ä¶
The purchasing process went easy and smooth. Their team was very accommodating in changing the delivery method of my order from local pickup to free delivery. However, the courier of their choice is TNT which is awful! Just read the reviews on the internet and you get it. My order was supposed to be delivered in Thursday last week and, instead I received a card in the mail that I wasn't at home so here you go! I was right at home, waiting for their arrival. What door they knocked on that I didn't notice, only God knows! Anyhow, today is Wednesday, almost a week has passed and I am still waiting for them to deliver the consignment. Have used their web portal, their automatic voice system and contacted their customer support many times since. Bottom line and the moral lesson is to not to tie your business reputation to a business partner that has such a poor performance and ugly reputation. I am not sure why you have chosen TNT, however I hope you hold them into account for their performance or choose a different courier if you don't want your own reputation damaged."

Better Music engages in deceptive charges. I ordered some products online and the website informed me that shipping and handling was free. I proceeded to checkout and was then charged $10 minimum shipping. Upon calling for a refund that their shipping policies are on the website and the charge is listed after the free shipping is advertised on the cart. A classic case of 'you didn't read the fine print'. Should have gone with a vendor that offers free shipping."

Awesome customer service. It started with an online chat as required guitar was not in stock. Advised that guitar can be ordered from Yamaha. We placed order. We received email confirmation straight away. We also received a phone call to discuss delivery options as we live on an isolated bush property. Received further notification when item was shipped followed by a tracking number. Every step of this transaction was factual and transparent. We knew where the guitar was through the tracking link. The driver rang us and delivered to our front gate. An awesome guitar that was delivered with awesome service. This is the best online service that we have come across. The staff at Better Music must be commended for what we deem 5 star service. We will recommend Better Music and will be purchasing our requirements in future from you. :-)"

I am extremely impressed with the awesome customer service, honest advice and excellent price I received from Better Music. After walking into a couple of music stores in Far North Queensland and feeling like the most important thing for the sales assistant was to make as much $$$ as possible, as opposed to listening to what I wanted and suggesting a guitar that matched the criteria, I was a little concerned about going down the route of ordering a guitar online. I need not have been as the excellent service and advice I received from Nathan and other members of the team at BM means that for the first time I have a guitar that I am absolutely thrilled with and am struggling to put down. My Taylor GS Mini-e Koa looks and sounds beautiful; it is also a delight to play! The customer service and help I received in the lead up to buying the guitar was excellent. I phoned the store several times and on each occasion Nathan took the time to listen to what I required and talk through the best options with me. I couldn't have asked for a more satisfying customer experience than that which I received at BM! Thank you!"

5508,1,2019-08-24T01:33:38.000Z,"Caveat emptor
Dealt with Better Music online numerous times now buying guitars online. Their prices are right up there with Mannys, Belfield Music, SCM & similar, and shipping is OK, so I thought I'd give them one last go. It was,...the last.

Of 12 guitars acquired over the past 18 months, 5 acoustics and 7 electrics, I bought 5 of them from Better Music, the majority (4) mid to top of range in respective segments in prominent brands any consumer of guitars would recognise. The experience has been very hit and miss & being a PITA to remedy. Mainly miss if you include the most recent purchase and subject of this review, the least expensive of the 5 -apparently almost a sin of itself according to their anonymous writer BM making a song and dance over that fact in the response. In this latest example, yet again Better Music demonstrated they are good on the talk, but don't walk the talk.

If you're buying something other than a guitar new in a sealed box e.g.keyboard, amp, keyboard bench, strings, they're possibly OK. After all what can go wrong? Guitars? Forget it unless you can walk in would be my personal repeat experience based advice.

Lots of spin about how 'we're selecting and inspecting the best example of the model in stock for you' paraphrased from their unsolicited message, but that's about as inverted as one could think of from what actually arrives. The only interaction I had with Better Music on this occasion was to press the buy button, pay immediately and await the guitar's arrival. Until of course, at their invitation, I wrote this review of my experience. My latest guitar buying experience prompting this review, is the rule rather than exception I am genuinely sorry to have to report. It arrived with numerous factory flaws and minor non-transit induced handling damage. One of glaringly obvious flaw where the neck join at the body hadn't been finish sealed and an obvious 3mm x 2mm patch of quite literally bare wood was showing! How could anyone in Better Music selecting 'the best' of numerous (5+ in stock) examples with functioning eyes miss that, or If they didn't, somehow think it acceptable to dispatch as 'of acceptable new quality' to a customer like that? To add insult to injury, it also came with another unwanted 'feature'. A small but deep dent made by a sharp edged object in the very hard polyurethane gloss spruce top below the strings in the typical strike and percussion area. Apparently my objecting to that as a consumer of a new guitar is inferred 'unreasonable expectation' as well. Do Better Music even inspect before shipment? Unfortunately indications are that they do, although a QC inspection isn't their reason apparently.

How do I know the item was 'inspected'? The guitar arrived with someone's unwanted DNA dirtily smudged all over it, another value added extra for which I'm apparently supposed to be appreciative and overlook as they do, clearly with the internal thin protective foam covering having been removed carelessly and torn in that process during said inspection, and replaced -without thought, concern or care. The guitar arrived with it torn, none anywhere near attached to and covering the head stock, and torn away completely from the bottom of the body. Unbelievably, an accessory item -tuner in blister pack, was floating around loosely in the box. How about having sufficient care and sense to wipe the instrument over with a clean microfibre cloth and take all of the additional 30 seconds it would to apply $0.0003c worth of clear packing tape to secure the accessory item to the box inner to prevent it floating freely banging into the guitar body and headstock?

If I could can walk in so I could inspect and reject or accept prior to taking delivery, I'd possibly have continued to use Better Music to buy guitars from. As an online buyer from a distance seller relying upon their pre-inspection process. FORGET IT. This was the final time for me.

At the time I wrote this, I'd sincerely have loved to rate Better Music 5 stars having purchased from them in good faith again, but based on their performance and this experience, they're lucky I awarded them 2, since downgraded to a 1 the consequence of my further experience of the mendacious malevolence in their responses. if I could, I'd give them a more richly deserved 0 if the Trustpilot system permitted on the basis of a subsequent conversation I shalln't report here.

For clarification it should be stated that I would have RMA'd the guitar as not of merchantable quality reasonably expected of a new item if this was my only experience of Better Music. But the simple fact is that they wore me down with their condescension equally apparent here to a point I couldn't be bothered with that rigmarole ever again or putting up with the torment and trauma of Better Music's interpretation of 'customer service', their euphemism for victim blaming. My remedy was and this time around will be to live with the pre-dent 'feature', fix the neck join defect myself with some dark polyurethane varnish and just rigidly avoid any temptation to ever buy a guitar from Better Music online in future. Caveat emptor.

UPDATE: Review downgraded to a single (1) star for reprehensible intentionally pernicious BEHAVIOUR demonstrated by BM's mendacious ghost writer. Yet again Better Music play their victim blaming card inferring the customer unreasonable -which is blatantly untrue. Quite apparently when they sent my a push mail prompt for a review, they only meant if the reviewer leaves five stars with some meaningless as it is vacuous single liner nonsense like ""Absolutely Amazing"".

The facts as stated in my review of this transaction and past dealings stand on their own merit which can be validated and verified by independent parties subsequently witness and involved. Better Music QC FAIL. Their ""refund"" 'solution' is inarguably a legal ""get rid of the problem"" one, but fails to address the core issues raised or provides the solution any bona fide customer might reasonably expect. Let's be very clear here. The reasons I didn't contact them on this occasion to option a refund or seek replacement prior to their misusing privileged confidential personal information here in a despicable attempt to invalidate the credibility of this author & the facts as stated through attempted character assassination in response is self evident in the review. The fact that Better Music chose to abuse the customer here rather than use initiative with a phone call to address the issue would not only have been smarter, but that they didn't in conjunction with my review here reveals all those actually 'hearing' the truth need to know about contempt for the customer embedded in the Better Music staff culture hidden behind a scripted smiley veneer.

Which gives rise to my reiterating, caveat emptor."

I had a number of deals with the Bettermusic shop there was no problem, as a result I trusted to do all my business with this shop my recent deal was a guitar‚Äôs strap, I was In a rush took a strap and paid for it, I decided to change the strap because the color didn‚Äôt have harmony with the guitar, I went to the shop to change the strap they said the strap is damaged and can‚Äôt be trade in, I checked the strap there was no damages on the strap only a tiny mark that with difficulty could be seen, however I noticed that I bought a faulty strap while the guy knows about it but denies. This was extreme dishonesty to threat a customer like that."
5718,3,2019-07-17T07:42:35.000Z,"BEWARE! In stock does not mean in stock.
The reason I went for this company was that my usual music store did not have the pedal I wanted in stock so went with these guys as their website said they had stock.

After placing the order, within 12hrs, I received an email informing me that the pedal was not in fact in store but was due to arrive within 1-3 days. I was disappointed but was assured that I would receive it before the weekend as I had selected ‚Äúexpress‚Äù courier for an extra $35.

Alas it came on the Monday week after meaning I did not have it in time even though I ordered it as ‚Äúin stock‚Äù 10 days before. I have suggested that the company review its policy on showing ‚Äúin stock‚Äù as it is very misleading (it can mean that they don‚Äôt have stock but the supplier does) also their shipping service and price is lacking. From another company that I usually order from offer express courier for $15 and it always arrives the next day.

Sorry but won‚Äôt be ordering from them again."

Before purchase told thru website 10 to 12 days delivery after 24 days of nothing I emailed them only to be told of delay and they are not responsible for the delay they were chasing the manufacturers. Got the product about 5 weeks later!
Big Tip if you are running low on stock and haven't replenished in time somebody has ducked up!

If you do not contact the customer as well I am guessing two or more experts have ducked up!

One side of the business letting the other side down sinks even the biggest of companies!"

The product was fine and as described. However I take issue with Better Musics policy of advertising a product as having free shipping. What they actually mean they won't charge you shipping if you pick it up at the shop. You have to go through to the point of confirming an order before you realize shipping will be an extra cost. Also the product was advertised on stock only to discover after the order had been placed they had to get it from the supplier.
All a bit underhand"

5851,2,2019-06-26T01:15:14.000Z,"DELIVERY hoops!
Buying online was easy but then you will have to verify that your credit card is legitimate which takes another 2-3 days and they use Star Track delivery service which doesn't tell you when they are delivering or what time which means there will be missed deliveries. After a re delivery order, you will also be expected to wait at home from 9-5pm (some of us have to work!) as they cannot ballpark when they will deliver the item. Overall, delivery of item is not seamless and it takes a lot of time and hassle to arrange it."

6072,1,2019-05-08T09:23:25.000Z,"Star Track is PATHETIC!
The service and response from your Salesman - Nathan - was good, but your company has made one majore bad decision - and that is to use Star Track. I will never buy from Better Music again due to the delivery service. First the delivery was delayed, Nathan told me Better Music had some internet issues, then Star Track told me the delivery came from Canberra, came to the Sydney depot, then went back to canberra, and then Sydney. Finally when they did arrive 2 weeks later we weren't home. I called Star Track again and gave authorisation to leave the $1000 sound equipment at our place, but NOT at the front door as I was concerned it would get stolen. I told the Star Track person to put instructions for the courier person to take the package up the side pathway and leave it on the side deck (as 2 other courier companies had done in the previous weeks with no problem). The person said they had added the notes and they asked me to give authorisation to leave the package and I agreed. two days later the courier arrived, we weren't home, they ignored the notes to leave the package on the side deck and left a 'We missed You' card. I called Star Track again told them what happend and they added more notes to the delivery and said the courier will definitely see the notes to leave the package on the side deck. I arrived home today to find the package on the front door, upside down and with the box opened!! I have called Star Track and made a formal complaint about this. I'm hoping that you will too since you have now lost a customer due to their pathetic delivery service."

Top quality!

My most recent purchase was a 22kg beast, a VOX AC15C1.
The tracking information was top-quality, I was able to track my online order with ease, through a simple email with a direct link to Star Tracking.

The amp arrived in half the time I was expecting, just a week, and was packaged perfectly. Once I got it out of the box, and plugged it in, I was hooked on the rich, saturated Brian May-esque tones I could get out of the amp, at a lower volume.

AND, the price was insanely cheaper than what I was expecting! $769, with free shipping!

Definitely going to be shopping with them again in the future! :)"

I ordered my item, to be advised that I had to wait as they were waiting on a backorder. I had paid express post at the time and was advised that this would be refunded to me as they could not express post something they did not have. My item finally arrived and was posted on a Friday. I have not yet received my item and it is nearly a week later. I have lodged a claim with Australia Post, however, when I raised my concern with Better Music, they just gave me the response that it was posted on Friday. It would be great if they could enquire from their end where the item is. It is effecting one of their customers and possibly future customers. It will definitely impact on whether I use this service, due to reliability of actually receiving the item. Oh and I have not received a refund for my express post."

6433,3,2019-02-21T01:43:04.000Z,"Power source not included
Bought a bass pedal, but it wasn't evident that the bass pedal didn't come with a power source - it was for a teenager, not a professional musician, so we didn't expect to have to buy this accessory. He was disappointed when he couldn't use the pedal right away.

When I went to purchase the additional power source at Better Music, I was told that I would have to pay freight because my order wasn't over $50, and then was pitched the higher-end daisy chain power source in order to meet the $50 threshold. My original order was $159. If I had known the power source was not included, I would have bought it at the time I ordered the bass pedal and wouldn't have incurred the additional freight cost.

I ended up purchasing the generic power source locally for the same price of $19.95, but without freight cost.

Two things could have happened differently: 1) It could have been made clear/obvious that an additional power source would have to be purchased for this product. 2) The Customer Service agent could have been empowered to offer me free freight on the second order. It would have been an act of good will. The Customer Service rep was courteous over the phone but was unable/unwilling to do anything to rectify the disappointing experience."

6459,3,2019-02-16T23:21:17.000Z,"guitar was awesome. Delivery not.
The company was fine and the guitar is excellent. However there were some issues with the delivery and their choice of courier which resulted in me having to pay a $20 redelivery fee for an item that was supposed to be held for 10 days but was returned to sender after 4. Anyway it got here in the end so first world problem but I will avoid buying anything that uses StarTrack & have given them a review also. Faster communication and waving the fee might‚Äôve been better ways of dealing with the miscommunication than just faulting me for not being here."

I ordered a keyboard in a different state to the shop on one day, and it arrived the very next day. Best price, free delivery and fast service - could not be happier! The only tricky part was that I had expected it to arrive within 7 days and the courier company didn't contact me to say it was being delivered until the courier actually turned up on the doorstep - thankfully I was only 2 minutes away. Apart from that, it was a faultless and seamless experience."

When the product arrived it was in the box, with the gig bag rolled up next to it, as a result there is a impact mark on the scratchplate. If a product is purchased with a case, it should be put in the case to protect it in shipping, like other shops do."

Soon after placing my order I received an email asking if I would like to cancel and get a refund or wait till early February when new stock arrived. I decided to wait and thought no more of it. I was surprised to receive an email saying my order had been shipped. It arrived a few days later. Impressed with their communication and commitment to fulfil my order. They were true to their word."

6479,5,2019-02-12T01:23:04.000Z,"Excellent service
Just a great experience purchasing through Better Music. Their service is exceptional. I back-ordered a drum throne online and the online service team contacted me immediately to update me on the expected length of the wait (due to the Australian importer).

I was offered comparable options as a substitute, but price-matched to the unavailable item I had ordered. Great!

Ultimately I opted for a better product, $50 dearer but with a small discount to get me closer to budget. The rep even checked stock personally to make sure I was getting it brand-new-in-box as it was the last one.

It's refreshing to order online but then be contacted directly (via email and phone) by someone who is willing and happy to satisfy the customer when things don't go as planned. Will use again."

Their price was competitive, they filled the order quickly and I received my keyboard in good condition at an interstate rural destination within eight actual days, acceptable though not spectacular for this location. All stages were notified by email so I felt confident all was proceeding as it should. Star Track tracking system worked well, except the package arrived at my front door before it registered as picked up from capital city but, as problems go, that's an okay one to have."

I've ordered a number of items from BM and 100% of the deliveries via StarTrack have had issues. BM, please use a different courier company. StarTrack is terrible. Nice people, but they have misplaced at least one item in EVERY order I have made from Better Music and have had to spend the next few days tracking it down from trucks to delivery centres. Only really return to BM for the price.

I recently online ordered an electric guitar, amp and pedal. While price was great, would be nice to get the added extras you get when shopping at a bricks & mortar store (throw in some picks, a strap or some cheap leads or something as an added extra touch).

Also, I previously ordered a keyboard - was disappointed with this purchase as the feel of the keys was not what I was looking for. Partly my fault for ordering online, but would be good to have some function for an online chat or sales assistant to help me with the purchase. Would have happily paid a couple hundred dollars more for the better feel on the keys (am now selling the keyboard on Gumtree).

Calling in to the guys at BM on the phone is great - super friendly and very helpful people (so nice that you kinda wanna grab a beer with them)... but would be good to have some more advice / engagement as I was making the purchase to help walk me through the item and provide an honest review."

Guitar setup and Suhr Aldrich Humbucker

Nick brought an Epiphone Gothic Les Paul back from the dead for me (with extreme vengeance). I had budgeted well above the cost of refretting, clean, service, setup and the installation of a new bridge pickup (the Suhr Aldrich). Nick charged me well below what I perceived was deserved, and the work was stunning. The guitar has transformed into a well handled sledgehammer of an axe where hard rock and metal is concerned. When comparing it to a Schecter with duncan designed blackouts on a simple Boss Katana Mini (on brown with gain at 3 o'clock), I was staggered by the overdriven tones that came from the Les Paul with this pickup over that of the duncans. Cranking the gain gave it even more of an overdriven sound, noting that the Katana Mini doesn't actually have an overdrive function on that model. Well, I guess it does now. There simply was no mud at all. Just articulated rage. I got the same feeling from the Fortin Nameless plugin and also a larger Boss Katana 100, only even better. Thank you Nick.

I purchased the Cort AF515CE guitar. I'm a bit disappointed because it doesn't accurately match the description or picture on the website.

The fretboard is meant to be rosewood but it really doesn't look like it, and after some research it appears that Cort stopped using rosewood in early 2017. The wood they've used is OK but it is several shades lighter with an unattractive grain pattern and it doesn't look as good as the picture.

I'm also a bit disappointed that the neck wasn't sanded much smoother during the manufacturing process, and the back and sides aren't quite as nice as I'd hoped for either.

In general, I got what I paid for: a cheap guitar. It still plays OK and is good value for money for what it is, but I regret not spending a bit more for a nicer guitar. I probably won't look at purchasing a Cort guitar again, especially not without seeing it in-person first."

Super fast delivery across the Christmas/New Year period. Website automatically offered a stand for the keyboard we were purchasing - the same option for a stool would be great"
6688,2,2019-01-04T00:36:46.000Z,"Poor Service From Startrack Express.
The item purchased was consigned via Startrack Express. They used a subcontracted firm called Campbells to deliver to my home in Albany,WA. Of course, I wasn't home so they left a card advising me to pickup at their office 4km out of town, opening hours 4-10am Mon-Fri. I arrive to find the office is CLOSED UNTIL 7th JANUARY.
Your service is only as good as the weakest link in the chain from store to customer. Won't be buying from you again. In addition, Campbells actually closed on 22nd December. How good is that if you were ordering a Christmas gift for someone on the 10th December? Locked in a warehouse til the 7th January!"

The service and everything about Better Music has been wonderful. The only downside is the shipping company you use and I suggest you move away from Toll as they are useless and are probably costing the company more in lost items and unhappy customers.

Other than that wonderful and would buy from again!"

I will shop online elsewhere next time - to have to call to have the goods shipped defeats the purpose of online shopping. I might as well have just called up. If you dont want to be an online business dont be. If you are worried about fraud, that should be your bank's problem. Tell your bank it is their responsibility to chase a payment made to you through another bank - you already had my money from CBA for goodness sake."

They had a good price on the mic so I will definitely consider shopping there based on price again BUT...... they had to get my microphone from their ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù to their store before sending it to me. I was notified when it was leaving the warehouse but then no further communication and the mic didn‚Äôt turn up. I eventually chased them up and they apologised for the oversight of not sending it.

He's very accommodating and patiently answering all my questions. To cut the story short I ended up purchasing it over the phone on 11 Dec 2018 morning. I received the item on the 12th Dec 2018 shipped to Sydney! That was a gold experience. Rudi was another person from Better Music that I would like to thank for assisting me with the tracking details. To summarise, the experience was smooth and hassle free.

Thank you for giving me the chance to comment - my service with Better Music was so outstanding I was planning to write to them anyway.
I purchased a ukulele for my daughter without knowing much about them, but having researched to ensure I was buying the correct instrument.
However, when I purchased the incorrect case online, a sales person not only called me to correct me on my mistake, but also informed me that the instrument actually came with its own case and she went out of ehr way to refund my money.
I contacted another salesperson because I had entered an incorrect delivery address, and he was only too pleased to alter the details.
To top it off, the instrument arrived much sooner than expected.
The salespeople may have cost themselves a $40 sale by informing me of my error with the ukulele case, however they have ensured that I and all I know will spend a lot more at their business in the future and will more than make up for it.
This is the best service I have experienced in years, and you should be proud of your staff.

Ordered a Maton from Better Music. Was naturally concerned about paying over $1,000 without seeing or playing the guitar. The discussion I had with Simon about this was excellent and gave me the confidence to go ahead. I ordered the guitar late on Thursday last week and I had it delivered the following Monday in perfect condition.
By comparison I had made a genuine enquiry to my local music store two weeks ago with the intention to buy locally- still waiting to hear back.
My experience with BM has been excellent and would deal with them again without hesitation.

BetterMusic is not a competent online business. Website checkout system 2/5, Customer service 3/5, delivery 1/5.

As a proficient online shopper I would avoid BetterMusic. My first order was CANCELLED without any notification because they listed item on their website which they had no stock. After 2 weeks, several calls and emails I was told to pick another guitar with lower quality wood (they assumed I would not know this).

My second order was received 14 days late and damaged. The Star Track contractors almost bullied me into signing the package. I was told to call the company on receipt and they don‚Äôt deal with damage items.
Currently I have a damaged guitar which I was suppose to gift to my small brother with down syndrome. He wont get it. I lost my money. My last hope is pay-pal resolution center."

Couple of negatives - time to post took a little longer than expected (about 2 weeks).
I'm guessing ""item in stock"" actually means its in a warehouse elsewhere and then have that sent to the shop to be mailed out?
Also the ""box"" it came wrapped in was bits of cardboard wrapped around the product, nothing wrong with that but looked a little unsightly and unprofessional.

Better Music is generally very good. But one really annoying thing about their website is that it does not indicate if they are out of stock of a particular item. They let you know after you have placed the order, that it might be ""two or three weeks"" or ""the middle of next month"", before they get new stock‚Äîbut that's of no use to anyone. Cancel order!!! Good people, yeah, but check with them first if things are in stock. (Which really makes their website into an online catalogue rather than a store‚Äîsilly really!)"

I bought the last set of Roland TD-17KVX V-Drums online just as someone in the shop bought them, bit unfortunate but it happens - the team was very apologetic and courteous, and offered to put me on a priority waiting list for the new stock to arrive in 4-6 weeks. It ended up only taking a week or so, and the guys shipped it Express at no extra charge.

Since then, I've had a couple of exchanges with them about buying some additional gear, and they've been super responsive and knowledgable. I'd have no hesitation buying from them again."

I went into the store to purchase a Yamaha PSRe363, explaining I had little experience with music and was going to try and learn. I accepted a suggestion that I purchase the better sounding Yamaha PSR e463. I am 71 years old and a retiree.

It was only weeks later that I realised that the 363 came with built in learning programs that would help me enormously. When I bought the 463 this was not mentioned to me or I would have bought the 363.

In the event I have purchased also the 363 so the lack of advice cost $400. I do realise that the 463 is a better instrument but neither will be any good unless I can learn to play. The 463 is in its box while I try to learn to play the using the 363 and learning software it has."

Better Music was not communicative about the delay in their supply of the product. The initial Communication stated that I should get the venova in a 3-4 days.

Suppliers didn‚Äôt give them a clear date on delivery, so they couldn‚Äôt tell me immediately when I will get it, but they also didn‚Äôt try to find out later on when the product is arriving.

On contact, they are polite, pleasant and helpful. But I would have preferred if they contact me if they have issues and not the other way around.

My venova itself is great."

I purchased a Chapman ML1 Pro Modern but unfortunately the guitar arrived completely unplayable. Fret buzz across all strings on 1st to 3rd frets (so severe on the treble strings the notes dont even sound out).

Edit 07/08 - Steve from Better Music contacted me the following day and with the help of a couple of pics and video footage I provided, he was able to identify the adjustments he felt needed to be done and was able to arrange a set up with one of their local contacts here in Perth.
Thank you Steve !"

Good customer service and comms via email and phone. Unfortunately the method of refunding a ""nominal"" amount back into your account to check CC details are genuine is frustrating, and delays shipment of order. After 3 days I still had not received this amount to check. I Understand its to protect the business against fraud, but at the inconvenience of genuine customers. I also suggest that this process is shown clearly on the product listing or at checkout, as I would have backed out had I seen this. Once product was dispatched, reached me in 24 hours, so this was great. Yet to open as its a Birthday gift, so hopefully all will be good."

7790,4,2018-06-20T07:13:33.000Z,"Good service but could use a better payment processing service
I ordered a piano from this store online and the customer service from staff was very good.

However my small complaint is that this store uses a payment processor which has a credit card verification system where they return a small amount of money on to your card, and you email them with the amount once it appears on your bank statement. In my case with Commonwealth Bank this took 3 full business days. I ordered on a Tuesday night, and the verification didn't arrive until Friday afternoon, and the piano wasn't dispatched until the following Monday. I suspect this is a cheaper payment processor for them than the ones that have to pay the banks to integrate with their security features like SMS verification etc. I understand they want to minimise overheads as a business, but for online customers this is a major inconvenience if you want your order in a hurry and have paid by card. So just be aware orders take a little longer to process if you are paying with credit card.

Better Music staff were apologetic and refunded the express delivery option, which I'm grateful for.

If they changed their payment processor to one that allows them to dispatch orders immediately I would give them 5 stars."

I requested to be updated if anything changed though after the date which was given I heard nothing and had to email to find out it was further postponed.

Better Music were excellent - regular communication and updates. Packaging was very sturdy -and arrived promptly to rural South Australia. Very easy transaction - website set up very well to aid decision making.

I will use the seat to take sports photography all day - the swivel lets me follow the play easily as I use a tripod. I have been using a smaller round-seat drummer's seat but it got uncomfortable towards the end of the day ... and my back was sore as it had no backrest.
This unit is really heavy duty - very strong and constructed. It looks as though it it is built to last and last and last though!
The saddle seat ""spreads the load"" and will be comfortable to sit on for hours ... which was my main goal in buying this seat.

8010,3,2018-04-16T05:16:31.000Z,"Disappointing
Having had a good customer experience in the past from better music I had no problem in ordering another product from them being a guitar amp. My amp arrived in due time and was packaged in the original products box. I was however missing a foot switch from the order. Once I notified the sales rep she was very swift in sorting it out but the communication from the store was that they were adament they had packed it and I assumed they must of packed it into someone elses order, who knows. So after asking me several times if it was in the box they sent me the missing item and it was sent very swiftly and all was good. However this morning I recieved my foot switch and I was very appalled at the packaging there was no padded protection in the box and the footswitch was very loose and had been bounced around in delivery perhaps, as the switches on the foot switch had pierced the box packaging so must of taken a bit of a battering being a small item and loose in the box to begin with. I suggest better music package the orders like this in bubble wrap or some paper padding or something but its very obvious to me as an average punter you would do this so it doesnt get damaged. Anyway I would be to frightened to order from better music again based on this packaging as I think it was just luck that the item showed no sign of damage, but it obviously had taken a bit of a battering that it wasnt design for and I cant see if there is any damage inside the component part."

When collecting my purchase in store, staff double checked to ensure that the speakers were compatible with the record player that I had purchased. They also opened the box to ensure that all of the cables were included.

They were professional, courteous and their expertise were appreciated by someone who has limited knowledge in the AV field."

I ordered a product and paid extra for Express Shipping. On the site it said that the product was in stock. Then I received an email saying that the product was in some other warehouse and needs to be ordered in which would take another couple of days.

I then wrote an email complaining that this is not express shipping anymore, but didn't receive any response.

The product, a guitar arrived safely, well-packaged and is awesome. So that is great.
I would have liked an answer, or some compensation for the Express Shipping cost or a small gimmick or store credit. I have worked in several online shopping companies, and that is usually what we did, go the extra mile to make the customer happy..

Other than that small hick-up I was happy with the handling, and the prices, the packaging and communication.

Having done a big purchase we wondered if it was going to arrive in time for our child's birthday, and it arrived within 2 days, with us being in Melbourne, and them being in the Northern Territories.
The only gripe, and why we hadn't given a 5-star rating was that another employee had rung us, and spoke to the children first before us the adults, and somewhat spoilt the birthday surprise. Still happy though with the quick service."

First of all, Better Music had the version of the product that I was looking for and other stores all over Australia didn't, and were selling a lower model for the same price as BM was selling a higher model of the prodduct. Besides they were offering free shipping. That was a no-brainer for me.

Then I got in contact with the online sales manager because I had questions about the product and specific restrictions of time when the item could be delivered. The customer service provided was excellent regardless if it was by email or by phone. BM accommodated the payment and delivery of the item based on my requirements and what would suit me better.

This buying experience was definitely 5 stars and I would keep BM at the top of my list for my next musical purchases."

8408,4,2018-01-15T23:59:21.000Z,"Fast, cheap, friendly
The description for the piano I ordered was relatively detailed, the price was far below anything else I found at any other shop, online or in Brisbane. This model was not even available yet with most retailers. I also appreciated the discount, free delivery plus a free stool! The customer service was very friendly, and the order was processed and shipped in a reasonable time. The piano arrived safely packaged and intact, no problems at all so far. However, I was not so happy with the delivery (Star Track) since they do not allow for detailed tracking, even when I called them they could not tell me at what time of day the delivery would arrive or even whether it would be delivered that day for sure, so I had to take a whole day off work and hope it would arrive that day to avoid having to collect a heavy and bulky package from the depot at the other end of the city. After reading several other reviews here, maybe Better Music could consider using a different delivery service? The other reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the 2-part delivery didn't arrive on the same day (the stool was forgotten), which happens and they were very nice about it and sent it out right away after I called. However, I specifically called to change the delivery address to get it delivered to work but I never got a delivery confirmation and the stool was still delivered to home.
So overall, the shopping experience with Better Music was great and I am very happy with the product and the price, the only thing that could be improved is the delivery."

There was a minor issue with my order and it took longer than expected to ship. Also, the ukulele I bought was a different colour/ shade (more yellow tones) to the picture display (a darker brown). A little disappointing as I did order the ukulele for its specific appearance, but I can get over it.. That risk just comes with ordering things online.
Though my experience with my order had some flaws I can say this is a reliable store with good response times. My order was also well protected in the post and came in good condition."

Very impressive customer service. I recently bought a Yamaha MX88 keyboard online from this store while they were out of stock. Not only did they keep me informed of the situation, but they posted it express - despite me not paying for this express postage. Furthermore, I was disappointed when I read on the package that Yamaha didn't include an AC adaptor with the keyboard, only to open the packaging and see that Better Music had included one - once again free of charge. I was very impressed by the service provided by Better Music, and would shop there again in a heartbeat."

However, even the Korg B1 has a nice quiet keyboard so why not the Kawai? I don't get it.

8548,5,2017-12-14T04:38:07.000Z,"Better Music - Best Music is a better desciption.
Better Music were absolutely brilliant. I cannot thank the team there enough for the service and follow up service after purchasing a drum kit for my son. It is easy to provide great service when selling something, but there is no better reflection of a company's genuine commitment to their customers than when something outside their influence goes awry - yes, interstate delivery at the craziness of Christmas time and the tracking wasn't working. From their end, Better Music acted promptly, contacted the courier company, kept me informed, and it was all resolved in less than a day. I have one incredibly happy kid, and we both would highly recommend Better Music. A call out to Joel, Morgan, Luke and Simon, (I hope I have all your names correct? Joel may be Josh?) thank you all so much."

I had a very good experience shopping on the website. Delivery was timely and the product works beautifully.

However, the box in which the product arrived was damaged. Thankfully this did not affect or damage the product itself.

I am not sure if this was damaged at the source itself or as a result of transport. In any case, always better to flag the issue."

8569,5,2017-12-07T13:01:14.000Z,"10/10 service guys....
Ordered an APX500iii fully knowing it was on backorder but happy to wait because it was $50 cheaper than anywhere else on the web and free shipping (that's important to me as im in far north queensland).

Got a phone call the next morning asking if i knew they didnt have stock and apologizing but told them i was happy to wait and already knew.

A few days later I get another call informing me that Yamaha wasn't going to be able to provide the stock because the new model comes out in january.

Long story short, BM (sorry i can't remember the nice guys name, i was half asleep) got me an APX600 (which isnt even released until mid-late jan) for significantly less than the previous model was worth and shipped it for free.

There is literally ONE reprinted article and ONE image of these guitars on the internet atm and i have one hanging on the wall beside my desk.

Side note: i settled on the blue apx500iii but didnt really like the colour (the greenish one from version ii was nicer), the new oriental blue burst is a combination of the two and it's totally gorgeous."

I have also found Better music easy to discuss the exchange of a particular product for another product of a similar value. For example, I had ordered the Yamaha MX88 but that was not in stock so I asked if I could change my order to buy the Roland FA07 instead. That wasn't a drama! Cool stuff."

Worst ever music retailer, bought a brand new gS mini bass only to receive one that has so many aesthetic flaws that even my kids question me why the aud1199 bass looks worst than their aud180 Yamaha jr2.

Hello, Morgan M was the name on the docket that came with my purchase of Behringer ULTRABASS Head BXD300H. Way back in the mid 2000's I had a Behringer 400T Ultrabass head which I used with my BB115 cabinet. The head was stolen when a friend was using it. So my BB115 has just been sitting under the house doing nothing.
I have basically just been using some low end bass practice amps but they just don't give the warm, rich sound I desire. I have been looking for quite awhile to get something to play through my BB115.
Now days I just get to jam under the house with utube or other portable music I play. When I was looking the other day your add popped up for the same piece of equipment that was on offer but yours was a cheaper price. It arrived today a day earlier than I was expecting and I played along to songs for a 4 hour jam session, playing around with it's settings. Very pleased and happy with what I have discovered so far.
Very happy with the purchase and transaction, so happy I stumbled across your website.
Thanks again, I think the wife will keep telling me to turn down the volume and it was only on '3' go figure.
One very genuine HAPPY customer :)"

I am based in Melbourne and initially was only wanting to purchase through BM for their pricepoint on a Bass amp head they had listed - unfortunately the item was on backorder (so i could have organised with any local retailer to purchase). I stayed with BM for the order purely because of the phenomenal service, effort and advice that I got from the Bass team (Alec). I most appreciated the fact that Alec was completely transparent, detailed and non-biased in all his advice and recommendations, and they were completely tailored to what I told him I was after - as opposed to being forced down a particular path or product line like i've experienced frequently in other music stores. Honestly, blown away by the service I received over the phone vs. service i have received face to face in stores - because of that BM will be my first choice to goto for any future purchases (despite the fact that I can't physically visit the store)."

8903,5,2017-09-12T06:35:37.000Z,"Exceptional Service
I can't speak highly enough of the staff at Better Music. The service I received was second to none.
I made an online purchase and was very happy with the price and the speed that my item was delivered.
Unfortunately the item had sustained some damage somewhere along the way, but once I notified the sales team, they couldn't do enough to help rectify it. They organised a courier to pick up the item and then had a new one delivered very quickly. I have just received the replacement item and I'm absolutely stoked with it!
Thanks to everyone at Better Music who looked after me. üòä"

However he had a different kit that was on sale that he would be able to swap it for. He asked my sons age and how long he has been playing drums. Seeing that the kit I originally ordered was $350 more than the kit he was replacing it with ( but the replacement one retailed more than the first kit I ordered ) he was happy to pimp up the new kit with better accessories. This was something I was happy to do. I was asked if I wanted a refund of the difference but preferred the upgrade to the kit. Overall I was really happy with the service that I recieved. Probably ended up with a better drum kit in the end. Thanks.üëç"

I did put down for store collection, however someone did package it up for postage. No big deal, and I collected it the day after the order went in. I do wonder if I had picked it up a day or so later woul it have been posted to me without my knowledge.

9113,5,2017-07-02T23:56:03.000Z,"BEST PRICE AND BEST SERVICE
I cannot rate Better Music any higher. I had been shopping around on Gumtree and Ebay as well as other local (Brisbane) retailers and found Better Music had the best price for the Bugera Veyron Mosfet Bass Amp.

Despite being an online special, I called the store and Greg was very helpful in discussing the product and placing the order for me. Although I did not specifically ask for any express delivery, I actually received an email from Greg within a few minutes of placing the order saying the shipment had already been dispatched to my Gold Coast workplace. This was Thursday afternoon around 2pm.

He advised it may get to me on the Friday but if not Monday (which I was already impressed with). In fact the amp reached me at 1.45pm on the very next day (less than 24 hours after placing the order). Tax invoices were emailed immediately as promised and I was lucky enough to get the amp in time to fiddle with it and perform that night.

RE the amp itself...I am over the moon at the quality of the amp and of course the price and service experience I got from Better Music.

A big thumbs up for both the amp and Better Music and I will definitely be using again."

Excellent service. From the moment I made the purchase of a guitar online, (which was a pre-order), I was kept in the loop as to what was happening with the shipment and put in the effort to call when needed, rather than just using email.

I was a bit skeptical buying a guitar online for the first time, but it was incredibly easy and worry-free, and it arrived all in one piece. They even offered to open the box to make sure it was in perfect condition from the shipment from America, before sending it to my place.

Would absolutely buy from this company again."

I bought an amp stand(RS4000) from Better Music and during the course of the purchase i asked them for their opinion(relying on their knowledge) as to the suitability of the product for my amp and was assured it was perfect.When the product arrived,it was too small for my amp.So i rang them and advised them...they said they would be happy to replace it,if i sent it back and paid for freight,paid the extra $ on top for the replacement and paid for the postage of the replacement stand!!! After arguing my point and going back and forth,the Manager of the store said that he would need to find out which staff member had mislead me in the purchase (25 plus staff) and if they admitted to it,he would replace the stand!!!? Can you see where this is going?...All this for a product that is worth $45...They also advertise as 'free postage' BUT they charge you $10 extra for anything bought under $50 !!! FREE POSTAGE?WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO 'CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT'? AND CUSTOMER CARE?They never listen to you,it's like you're talking to 'f...n' robots or they are reading off a script.I would never recommend to deal with these 'rip off merchants'.Once this petty nightmare is over....never again."

Went with 2 stars only because customer service is absolutely awesome. Thank you Nathan. However item was ordered online and they sent it to billing address. It was sent back to warehouse for correct delivery. A week later and it still hasn't been delivered. Paid for express postage which they reimbursed. But delivery company -StarTrack- have really messed up and caused a major problem for the shop. Sorry guys but you keep telling me that it will be delivered tomorrow and it just isn't happening. Now I have to wait another three days at least which will be almost two weeks. Totally unacceptable as far as I am concerned."

9355,3,2017-03-29T01:29:19.000Z,"Reasonable service but a few minor issues
Before purchasing online I made a few enquiries about their price match as I could get the same item a bit cheaper elsewhere. Those enquires seem to have been overlooked (or ignored), but other enquires were answered very promptly. In the end I was able to get the item quicker than the other cheaper store so I let the price match issue slide. I picked the item up in store and got the new guy who wasn't sure about the process and had to wait for a more experienced staff member to guide him. Again, not a big issue but for a premium store it shows a lack of training. Finally I was carrying my son when I picked up the item (a guitar in box) and there was no offer to help me carry the guitar to the car. I managed OK, but the store wasn't busy and it would have been nice to have a little help. These minor issues won't stop me buying from the shop in the future."

9530,4,2017-01-03T01:31:07.000Z,"Great Customer Service
I made a sizable on-line purchase. Within an hour a customer service rep from Better Music called to confirm my order and delivery details. Very polite individual, easy to understand and covered all details of the purchased product.
The delivery date was confirmed and arranged specifically for a day I would be at home, after the Christmas holiday period. However, Startrack decided to deliver a day early while i was still Interstate. Left a card and when i called the next day to arrange delivery again they said ""no deal"". It was come and collect at our depot or wait another week for delivery. So, a two hour round trip and i had my purchase, but extremely p'ed off at the extra time and expense involved when a specific date was arranged.
So, in short, Better Music are excellent to deal with and have a great website and simple ordering process.
The same can't be said of the consignment delivery provider they use - Startrack. That's why 4 stars and not 5."

Had to find a last minute Christmas gift for a family member. The guys at Better Music were so helpful in helping me find the product I was after and in posting the item that day so I would get it in time. I had to ring again a few days later to ask a question about the product. The person I spoke with was very patient and polite. I was told I could ring back any time and ask for advice regarding the product I bought. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this business to others!"
9543,2,2016-12-26T09:52:13.000Z,"Incorrect shipping.
I paid for express shipping in order to receive the product as a Christmas present for my children. Better Music failed to send it express, despite sending me an email confirming the express shipping. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because the man I spoke to at Better Music was very apologetic and refunded me the cost of delivery. Unfortunately though, this didn't solve the problem of my children going without their Christmas gift."

i received the goods in perfect condition several weeks after ordering. My only complaint is that it was not immediately obvious that the item ordered was not in stock. the web page may have said this but unlike other websites it was not that obvious. however, the next day i was contacted by the store and they offered an immediate refund, which is great. i choose to wait because they got on to my complaint straight away. attentive customer service especially when things aren't quite right is worth gold. i'll use this store again."

I have bought an SG and a Strat for myself, my son has bought 2 guitars and had his amp serviced. Never have had a problem with the service or attitude of the staff at Better Music.

9628,5,2016-11-27T03:06:38.000Z,"Best customer service out there.
I bought an amp from these guys, and got a call from customer service to tell me the box they had for it was a little dented. I think you'd have to be an epic control freak to care about that from a customers perspective, of course I said it was fine. But it was that attention to detail and focus on customer satisfaction that really stood out for me (as well as having the best price on the item I was after in Australia with free delivery.) 10/10, will shop with them again, I couldn't be happier."

I was so happy and excited to receive my new TD-25V Drums and wasn't disappointed when I played them for the first time. Awesome!!
The only thing is to make sure the Mapex Kick pedal actually fits the Roland kick drum bracket. Ii kept slipping off so had to do a slight modification but all is sweet now.
Great service from the Better Music team. Thank you."

I had been trying to locate a specific model of Ovation Guitar for about 2 weeks. I was struggling to find a supplier in NSW (and Australia). Contacted Ovation in the USA and through the local distributor they put me in touch with Better Music. Spoke with Matt the store manager. He emailed me pictures of the guitar to confirm it was the right model and within a day I had the guitar shipped and delivered. Everything I requested Better Music provided. Really Great Service!"

The only glitch was their website was outdated and the advertised piano was not available. However, they offered a close enough replacement.

Another good thing Better Music has fantastic pricing!!

I ordered a compact digital piano with stand, pedal board and a stool. The piano stool arrived within time, the piano was misdirected to Perth and I had to follow this up. When the piano arrived, the pedal board and stand were missing and I had to follow this up because it wasn't dispatched. Thankfully it was sent out immediately and they threw in a free set of headphones. Perhaps they need to consider another shipping company."

I have made a number of purchases through these guys now and would always go back. Canberra is lucky to have such a great music store - big enough to have a full range and price match their competitors - these guys also are small enough to be customer focussed. Very relaxed laid back atmosphere and one of the best music shops I have ever been in. These guys clearly enjoy their work and it's a bit infectious."

I would recommend Better Music to anyone looking for a musical instrument or accessories.

I ordered online from Central Queensland, it arrived the 2 nd day after ordering, I have never received something so quickly and considering the parcel came from Canberra it is amazing, they must have the speediest time for getting the instrument to courier and the best courier.

I was in need of a Roland Juno DS88 and was asking all the music stores in Brisbane (where I live). Some didn't have any and couldn't really figure out how to get them in other wanted to charge outrageous prices and others were just rude. After speaking to Rudi my confidence was restored in mankind and I was able to get my keyboard sent to me (finally). He even offered to price match another place that I was looking at. He would always respond to my email and phone calls with little delay and answered all my questions with a certain amount of panache."

I am very satisfied with my experience with Better Music and will certainly consider them my first port of call if needed again."

After super fast, helpful response to query I purchased the item which was then delivered very fast unlike an online Queensland music store with 'revolting' service : kept me waiting for over 3 months for the same item then claimed it had been sent. Fortunately after pressure from PayPal I received a full refund. Better Music seem to care about their customers and have delivered faultless service!
Thankyou"

The Better Music shop, was fantastic. Being on a Australian army pension, they helped me with picking which is mine now ML-1 Pro chapman guitar. They even phoned to make sure I was home for delivery nice quick. They set up my guitar for so out of the box it was perfect for me. I'll be using them again for sure, I highly recommend trying them out and go to web site or give them a call. I would not write this if I didn't have such good service.

I was having major problems finding a 1/2 size guitar case for a guitar (that I bought elsewhere) that was marked ""1/2 size""

But it wasn't international half sized.

I learnt this after the boys in the Acoustic Session went the EXTRA MILE and provided me with a wealth of knowledge on international 1/2 size specifications.

Suffice to say I took said guitar back to be replaced with an international 1/2 sized one.

But made sure I came back to Better Music for the case!

Thanks again for all the help."

The service I received from Better Music was the best I've experienced from any on-line company.

The product was received in good order and was everything as advertised. I used it live on stage immediately it was received with no problems at all.

9822,4,2016-08-21T06:24:06.000Z,"Helpful, friendly staff. Excellent prices.
I ordered a Roland TD-25K drum kit with throne and pedals. Better music had the best prices and the website was easy to use to place the order. This review would have been 5 stars (I would give them 4.5) but it took a bit longer than I would have expected to get my order. Partly this was due to their credit card verification process which took about 48 hours to sort out as I was a new customer and they have a nominal refund process like PayPal which took a bit to clear in my account. This was fine, but it would have been nice if they were a little more upfront about this on the website, and were a tiny bit more responsive to queries.

They use StarTrack for couriers at least for the free shipping option. Unfortunately StarTrack seem to have a lot of problems. My delivery was 2 days late since they left part of the package in Canberra the first day and then the delivery driver claimed that they couldn't deliver to our address because the office was closed (which was garbage). While this is not really BetterMusic's fault, maybe they want to consider a better courier.

But I need to stress how extremely minor these complaints are, and I would definitely order from them again."
9823,5,2016-08-20T12:14:23.040Z,"Great!

I found Better Music while browsing on the internet. What first attracted me to look in more detail was the range of gear and more importantly in today's economy were the very competitive prices. The online purchase was simple and secure , although the item was not in stock at the time , the follow up emails relating to expected delivery , and then both confirmation of receipt into stock and dispatch were welcome. Most importantly they were accurate ,in fact I received my purchase one day early by courier to my door . I will certainly purchase from Better Music in the future."

Additionally, it's easy to organise pick up of items from the store here in Canberra. Even if some items arrive a day or two apart. It's fantastic to walk into Better Music, be greeted by a friendly and alert staff member, and then depart the store, goods in hand, within five-ten minutes."

Excellent product quality and service. Very happy. Will definitely shop here again."

Great service, super fast turn-around."
9848,5,2016-08-08T03:13:51.000Z,"Would shop here again.
The website caused problems when placing the order and switching to PayPal as I had to put in a delivery address different to my own details. It made two errors I needed to rectify.
Otherwise fast, efficient service that was slightly mind-boggling.
Thanks"
9849,5,2016-08-07T21:21:18.000Z,"Better Music better service
Having a fairly large guitar and amp collection have dealt with many on line music business's and I have found Better Music to be most professional. I was kept up to date with accurate shipping dates and one of the two items I ordered cames a daybefore anticicpated arrival, my 2nd item was 6 weeks away which they advised me within an hour of my order. To sum up a pleasure to deal with."

I just couldn't believe how fast the delivery was. I was fully expecting to not see my violin for at least 7 days, but it arrived in less than 44 hours after placing my order. It seems as though they sent it through express post, even though I didn't pay for it, which was just brilliant. Thank you Better Music! :D"

Super happy with the service from Better Music. Ordered an electric piano from them and it turned out one part was out of stock (3 pedal set). They immediately emailed me to let me know and offered to send the parts that were in stock straight away and the out of stock item when it came in. They had taken the trouble to confirm that the piano would definitely still work in the mean time. They then followed this up with a phone call to make sure I understood everything and was happy. Then they made sure it was shipped straight away and I got my delivery a day earlier than expected. At all times they were very helpful and professional. 10/10 would buy from them again."
9861,5,2016-07-30T06:01:30.000Z,"Superb service
I took my 12 string guitar into the shop today 30th July and the guys in there gave me the most superb service and advice. I've been to other music stores where the service was nothing like this. I'll never shop anywhere else for my music needs as long as Better Music is around!"
9862,5,2016-07-29T06:13:06.000Z,"Great to deal with.
These guys are always so easy to deal with.

Had ordered an item & requested express courier service as it was a birthday present.Delivery was slated at 1-5 working days which I thought was a bit excessive for Express service.(5 days?) Hadn't received any tracking info by end of second day so sent an email to them.Apparently the item requested was out of stock but not listed as such on their website.They made contact the next day & promptly forwarded a similar item albeit not the colour I originally desired but satisfactory.Past dealings have been hassle free with prompt delivery so will forgive one little hiccup."

Good purchasing experience as the staff had kept me informed about what to be expected, and kindly arranged for delivery before last Sat as requested .

A bit frustrated when Startrack did not do the delivery as per the original ETA 20/07/16 while I waited at home for a whole day. But after I communicated with Startrack on 21/07/16, the delivery finally happened on Friday 22/07/16, and met my requirement. And the Startrack staff did send the good to door - my unit located on Level 2. If it was delivered only to the gate of my building, it would be pretty hard for me, as there are no lifts.

Overall, it's a good buying experience. And I love the piano.

Thank you."

Once I reached my home in Victoria's East Gippsland, I gave the purchase a little more thought. On a Monday afternoon I hopped onto the Better Music website, ordered the model I wanted and on Wednesday morning it was delivered to my front door. Very impressive.

When buying online through their store they use a protocol that requires you to confirm that you are the actual owner of the credit card. This slows the first purchase down by a few days, but increases your confidence in their business practice.

When I ordered a number of items through them the courier failed to deliver one item. One email query to the store and the item was re-delivered the next day.

9954,5,2016-06-06T10:56:21.000Z,"Better Music Rocks!
I had been doing my homework on a digital piano for the kids. After reading billions of reviews, watching just as many youtube clips and plotting the pros and cons of the few models I had narrowed it down to, then pondering on it way too long, I finally rang Better Music and asked a few questions. I spoke to Rudi who really knows his stuff (and I was pretty chuffed I was speaking with the youtube man himself). Anyway, long story short, I should have spoke to Better Music a lot earlier. The knowledge and advice was just what I needed. I purchased the chosen digital piano via the online store. The next day the store contacted me in regards to delivery and to see what day suited best for delivery. Two days later we took delivery of the piano. It was the easiest, no problem purchase ever; which is just what you want when purchasing such items. I would definitely recommend purchasing from Better Music. And if you need advice before you purchase, give them a call. Thanks so much Better Music :)"

The service was good in providing a great product that was easy to organise however once the product arrived the store called to let me know it was ready for pickup when I had paid for it to be delivered as I live interstate from the store location. This then meant it took longer for the pedal to arrive than I had anticipated. Other than that the information to keep track of the shipping was very handy.
My regards, Ben."
9997,5,2016-05-16T20:44:58.000Z,"Fantastic service!
I purchased a Kawai digital piano from these guys. Not only do they offer the most competitive prices (and I did my research) their service and delivery is exceptionally fast and efficient. I included a bench with my order and as soon as the order went through I received a call from Rudi telling me that a bench came with the piano and he wanted to make sure I didn't require another one. They were very fast in getting the money returned to me for the extra bench and were so friendly and understanding through the entire transaction. Communication was great and I was never left wondering, which happens with online shopping. I made the order on a Thursday and my piano arrived the following Monday (I live in Brisbane) and I love it!! I have no hesitation in recommending Better Music to anyone and they would definitely be the go to in the future. Thanks to Rudi and Luke"

Called them on Monday to ask about a trumpet mouthpiece, as I wasn't sure which one to order (the number given to me by my son's tutor did not match up with numbers on any websites). The first person I spoke to wasn't totally sure this was the correct mouthpiece. Someone called me back within minutes and gave me direct instructions on which one to order online on their website. Ordering it on the website saved me postage and the price was already discounted on this item as well. The order arrived two days later. This was my second purchase at this store, the first one having been as efficient and pleasing as this time."

10000,5,2016-05-15T14:02:50.000Z,"Excellent online services and extra fast delivery
I regularly do my shopping at ebay for my music instruments and gadgets. I learn to wait patiently, generally 10 days - 2 weeks to receive my order from Australia suppliers. Sometime there was no stock, days to work out when I will get my order, and wait for few days for delivery.

However, the Yamaha THR10 is not on ebay and Better Music got the best price. I decided to call to find out if they have the stock on particular model I want to buy. The online sell service call was excellent, they know what they got and clearly explained how my order will be delivered. I placed my order after I hang up the phone. Five minutes later, I got a phone call from Better music that my order will be delivered tomorrow! How's that for the prompt service! less than 24hrs and I will get my order!

Surely I am one of their happy customers. I am sure next time if I need anything for my instruments, I will check out Better Music first, lots of good brands, including Yamaha Instruments.

Keep up good work guys!"

I just started self-teaching myself playing the violin and it's been very easy with the stentor 2 student violin. It's easy to tune, made from premium materials and the case is quite sturdy. The sound it produces is amazing, very solid, loud, deep tones. If you want to start playing the violin definitely pick this one up. It's very affordable and it's quite worth it for it's price. Very happy with this purchase!"

10023,5,2016-04-30T06:24:14.000Z,"Great Customer Service
To begin with I was disappointed that I had been sucked into the purchase of a product listed as ""In Stock"" when it was communicated it was on back order AFTER payment had been made. Unsure if this is an accepted tactic of competitive on-line retailers in Australia to secure a sale or if it was an honest inventory management mistake.

If the item was listed as backorder with a note saying new stock to arrive within the week, I still would have purchased as I have dealt with Better Music previously and have been more than satisfied.

The frustration however soon diminished once there was some email communication regarding the order and the staff at Better Music were fast with their response, polite without being patronising and very willing to assist. Seems evident that the floor staff responding to email are also fellow musicians themselves without the snobbery and smart alec know all responses I am used to. Very satisfying talking to the staff at Better Music and thanks to Luke and Jol for their assistance."

Paying by Paypal was a huge incentive to buy online. Clear product descriptions, transparent fees and postal charges helped to make an online shopping experience quite easy. Despatch was very prompt and the parcel arrived earlier than expected. However, the billing address was erroneously displayed on the parcel instead of the shipping address which caused some confusion at time of delivery: the article ended up at my front door instead of my Post Office Box where I had asked for it to be sent."

I am absolutely delighted with my Casio Privia. It looks great and sounds even better - it really has a grand piano feel and sound. It has many outstanding features - accompanying an orchestra is just one of them. I shopped around and Better Music's price was over $300 cheaper than other outlets. My new piano arrived within a week of my order and delivery was free. I could not be happier with the product and the service. Thank you Better Music."

I can't fault Better Music, from the professional and energetic staff to the great range of products they supply. I live an hour and a half away from better music and have had difficulty sourcing some drum spare parts for my teenage son. They went above and beyond, contacting the supplier and sending the parts directly to us. I recommend Better Music to anyone who has the need for a musical shop."

10082,5,2016-04-04T23:33:57.000Z,"Best shop in Canberra - and compares well to the best in NSW and VIC
I love Better Music. It's got a really good vibe, the people are knowledgeable, helpful, and genuine. The prices there are very competitive, and they also price match - so you can't go wrong. The only thing that disappoints me is that quite a few times I've gone into the store - they haven't had the guitar(s) I wanted to look at or buy in stock. They often say 'sorry it's on order'. I know it's difficult to keep everything in stock - as shops sell things(!) Maybe I've just been unlucky, or maybe they could just keep a closer eye on stock levels? Either way, a superb shop!"
10083,5,2016-04-04T00:12:42.000Z,"Thumbs up

A very competitive price. Hundreds of dollars cheaper to purchase from interstate and ship over rather than buying from any of my local stores. The communication through email was outstanding and very prompt and the delivery time was exceptional and very reasonably priced too considering the size of the product. I had a little handwritten note placed with my invoice thanking me for my purchase which I thought was a nice touch too. I would very happily purchase through this company again. Thank you guys."

Their site was easy to navigate and because I was using the church's credit card to pay for the goods I was pleasantly surprised to see them use a refund system to confirm ownership of the card (much like PayPal). This gave me great peace of mind.

The item was well packed and even had a personalised message.

It's attention to detail like that which makes an online store feel Luke a retail center. And their prices were second to none.

Highly recommended."
10100,5,2016-03-18T11:29:57.218Z,"Best online customer service.

I booked a sustain pedal for my piano online knowing it would arrive after at least 4 days. 2 days later the customer service called me to inform my order had been sold out and suggested me that since it was their fault not editting their online website, I could get an even better pedal with the same price.

If that isn't awesome enough, the better pedal arrived on the day after, which was a day earlier than my expectation.

Simply marvelous flexibility."
